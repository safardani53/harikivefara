I was a painter and decorator. I was a postman. You name it. I've done it.</p><p>"I was an apprentice roofer as well. I carried tiles up and down a ladder all day.</p><p>"I wasn't the biggest lad so other apprentices were carrying eight tiles up a ladder and I was carrying two or three. And they were ripping me. So I'd try and do more. I nearly fell off the ladder on several occasions. It just wasn't for me."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on Football">Read More on Football</h2><p>Speaking about his time as a postman, he added: "I was still out there at seven o'clock at night trying to go through my round.</p><p>"I was just trying everything that could offer some kind of balance with football and then finally, believe it or not, I landed a job as an aerobics instructor."</p><p>Shortly after calling quits on his playing career, Trout was invited to play in an organised game at his former club, Lincoln.</p><p>After the full-time whistle, he was approached by a scout who asked if he would consider a full-time scholarship at the University of Illinois Chicago.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Football</h2></p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong><a href=# aria-label="FREE BETS AND SIGN UP DEALS - BEST NEW CUSTOMER OFFERS (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">FREE BETS AND SIGN UP DEALS - BEST NEW CUSTOMER OFFERS</a></strong></p><p>The ex-midfielder added: "I was 22, I had split with my girlfriend maybe six months before and was an aerobics instructor. I was just like, 'Let's just do it. Let's just have a go. If I didn’t like it then I'd just come home.’"</p><p>Although he initially attempted to go professional as a player in the US, Trout eventually set his sights on coaching and landed a job at MLS club Chicago Fire.</p><p>After a while in the role, he started a video analysis company.</p><p>During this time he formed a connection with the Puerto Rico national team after agreeing to help then-manager Dave Sarachan.</p><p>The pair formed a close bond, so much so that Sarachan wanted Trout to take over from him when he left his position at the Blue Hurricane earlier this year.</p><p>Trout revealed: "Dave left and they offered me the job. It was an opportunity I couldn't turn down.</p><p>"Some people will say, 'Well, I didn't realise Puerto Rico had their own team because they're part of America.' But football is growing massively here.</p><p>"We have young, eager, committed players that have a passion for the game. And even though football in the country is not top of their list of sports. It's growing. The love is starting to get there."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Trout's team will face Martinique on Tuesday evening.</p><p>The winner of the match will secure qualification for the CONCACAF Gold Cup.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH9zg5RpbWxqX6W8tMDMmqVmpp%2Bpwaq6xqGYpmWppMKvs8Ssq2ahnqmys7rAraCoppGheq6tzZqenqqjYrCprdGloJ5lpKe8tsCO</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./khloe-kardashian-blonde-hair.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kim Kardashian: Blonde Hair! - The Hollywood Gossip">&larr;
