The air hose then needs to be positioned so the hot air blows out of a window.</p><p>The digital control is really clear and easy to use, with three modes - air conditioning, fan and dehumidifier. You can select the fan speed and choose to have maximum or medium power or to make the unit silent.</p><p>It's also possible to control the temperature, and use the timer to programme the unit to switch on and off at certain times to maximise its efficiency.</p><p>We tried the De'Longhi Pinguino out in a hot loft bedroom and it was very effective at keeping the room cool and comfortable in a sweltering summer heatwave.</p><p>We used the unit to cool down the room during the evening and turned it off overnight, but you could leave it on as it's fairly quiet (maximum of 64 decibels) and shouldn't disturb your sleep.</p><p>The only issue was that it was challenging to use with a skylight window as we had to raise the hose to reach the window, whilst keeping it on a flat surface as recommended for safety. Plus, we needed to block the window gap at the bottom to prevent the hot air from flowing back into the room.</p><p>For most windows, this wouldn't be such a problem and the unit should work effectively. However, the ideal solution would be to install the unit permanently with a hole through a wall and the instruction manual talks you through how to do this.</p><p>Overall, we were very satisfied with how well the De'Longhi Pinguino was able to cool a large space, and we found it to be unobtrusive and quiet.</p><p>We also liked that the unit provided a clear and constant update of the room temperature and that you're able to set a timer and change the settings easily from the unit or with the remote control.</p><p><strong>Weight: </strong>30kg<strong> Power: </strong>2.4KW&nbsp;<strong>Noise level: </strong>64dB<strong> Dimensions: </strong>17.7 x 15.6 x 29.5cm <strong>Warranty: </strong>Limited</p><h2>Best Smart Air Conditioner: Honeywell Portable Air Conditioner</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image0-3-rotated.jpeg><ul><li><strong>Honeywell 9000 BTU Portable Air Conditioner With Voice Control, £299 from Airconcentre - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/5</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Sleek look, smart features, multiple modes</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Setting up smart features is a bit of a faff, odd smell when you first turn it on, heavy</p><p>The Honeywell Portable Air Conditioner certainly makes a good first impression.</p><p>It's sleek, unassuming and extremely easy to set up; you simply slide it out of the box, plug it in and you're ready to use its most basic features. If you want to move it upstairs, you might need a partner, though: it's not dainty, at 71.5cm tall and 30kg.</p><p>To get it set up as a fully-fledged air conditioner you obviously need to plug in the air hose, but Honeywell provides easy-to-follow instructions to get that sorted. Like most air conditioners, it's best suited for sliding windows; if you don't have them, you can just stick the hose out of your casement window, though.</p><p>The remote control is super handy for when you have had enough but can't quite make it off of the sofa and it can be conveniently controlled by the LCD screen.</p><p>Like many of the units in this list, this is an air conditioner that doubles up as a fan and a dehumidifier, which is extremely useful for drying laundry, and means that you can still stay cool without having an ugly hose sticking out of the window (we did notice a bit of a fishy smell when we first used the fan setting, but it quickly dissipated).</p><p><strong>Weight: 28</strong>kg <strong>Power:</strong> 1KW <strong>Noise Level:&nbsp;</strong>65db <strong>Dimensions: </strong>36 x 71.5 x 44 cm</p><p><strong>READ MORE:</strong></p><h2>Best Budget: Devola Master 10000 BTU Portable Air Conditioner With Cooling & Heating</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-3-3.png><ul><li><b>Devola Master 10000 BTU Portable Air Conditioner With Cooling & Heating, £289.95 from Devola - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></b></li></ul><p><strong>Rating:</strong> 3/5</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Easy to use, decent temperature range, easy to wheel around, different modes, heating function</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Complicated to install, Doesn’t fit all windows, difficult to place</p><p>The Devola Portable Air Conditioner is a great solution if you’d like a more heavy-duty cooler/heater combo that also has multiple functions.</p><p>At first, installing the air conditioner took a bit more time as the instructions weren’t clear on how to assemble the exhaust hose and window kit. Deciphering the instructions was tricky and we did find that it doesn’t fit on some windows in the house. We couldn’t get the window to close properly. It wasn’t a bother as we wouldn’t leave it on without being present in the house and wouldn’t matter as much if it was placed on a second floor.</p><p>Although it has an extending hose, it's tricky to find a location to place it if you live in a small space as it needs to be near or next to a window, and can’t be put near heating sources or objects that could block its outlet. Bigger spaces may not have as so much of an issue but we eventually placed it in an empty spot underneath a window.</p><p>The LED display functions, buttons and remote control make it very simple to use and alternate between the different modes it has; a cool mode, dehumidifier, fan, and heat. The remote control was also easy to use and great for those lazy sofa days.</p><p>The range of modes provides a lot of versatility and is one of its best features; the dehumidifying mode was ideal for drying clothes, while the fan instantly cooled down a room when the temperature got warm.<br>The heating fan was pleasant and we found that it was a gradual heat without being too drying.</p><p>Despite being small in size, it’s fairly powerful and instantaneously spread air across the living room. Although the exhaust hose isn’t aesthetically pleasing, it does make for a powerful air conditioner and its energy efficiency makes it a great choice for continual use during summer.</p><p><strong>Weight:</strong> 25kg <strong>Power:</strong> 1.1KW <strong>Noise level:</strong> 65dB <strong>Dimensions:</strong> 701x350x348 mm <strong>Warranty:</strong> 2 Years</p><h2>Best combined dehumidifier and air conditioner: AEG COMFORT 6000</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0967-rotated.jpg><ul><li><strong>AEG COMFORT 6000, £649.99 at AEG - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Rating:</strong> 5/5</p><p><strong>Pros:&nbsp;</strong>Easy setup, quick cooling, brilliant app</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Expensive, heavy</p><p>This AEG air conditioner was given a real test over a couple of weeks in a London flat that rarely dips below 25C in the summer.</p><p>A combination of large windows and a south-facing wall meant the Comfort 6000 had its work cut out, but it rose to the challenge and quickly cooled a large 26C living room down to a much more comfortable 21C in around 20 minutes.</p><p>Getting the AEG unit set up was easy (except for the bit where we carried it from the street to the apartment; at 30kg it's very heavy!).</p><p>Once it's out of the box, it's pretty much plug-and-play. The only bit of installation required is attaching the extractor hose to the back of the unit and pointing it out of a window.</p><p>Now, this didn't work in every window; the hose couldn't reach the tilt-only windows in the flat we tested it in, so it had to go out of the French windows on the balcony.</p><p>Like with all portable air conditioners, the extractor hose (collapsed in the picture above) is a bit of an eyesore, but besides getting a hole drilled in your wall, there aren't a lot of alternatives; it's a price you have to pay for effective cooling.</p><p>Aside from the hose, though, the AEG is quite good-looking as larger appliances go.</p><p>It's easy to use, too, whether you choose to use the simple buttons on the control panel or connect the unit to your phone via WiFi.</p><p>The app is a great feature that allows you to control the Comfort 6000 remotely, setting the temperature wherever you are and getting a notification when the AC has done its job.</p><p>It's got a few other features too, including a powerful fan and a dehumidifier mode (which requires the attachment of an included hose to collect the moisture) which makes the AEG a do-it-all appliance.</p><p>In all, we're fans of this air conditioner: it works how it should and, if you can stomach the price, you won't be disappointed.</p><p><strong>Weight</strong>: 33.5kg <strong>Power</strong>: 3.4KW <strong>Noise level</strong>: 64dB <strong>Dimensions</strong>: 70.5x47.2x38.3cm <strong>Warranty</strong>: 2 Years</p><h2>Best plug-and-play air conditioner: Midea Comfee 9000 BTU</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Midea-1-e1686648774762.png><p><strong>Rating</strong>: 3/5</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Easy setup, portable</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Lacks power</p><p>While this Midea Comfee won't manage larger rooms, it's decent for bedrooms and home offices that overheat in the summer.</p><p>Its standout feature is just how quick it is to get working.</p><p>It took our tester, who's by no means a DIY whiz, under a minute to get everything connected and plugged in.</p><p>As portable air conditioners go, it's quite a compact machine and was easy to manoeuvre around a small flat depending on what room needed cooling.</p><p>Like the other air conditioners on this list, it requires a flexible hose to be placed out of a window or sliding door, so you'll want outside access in whatever room you put it in.</p><p>Once we had the Midea placed in our room of choice and out of the box, the installation process was a breeze.</p><p>The settings on the Midea are easy to work, whether you're looking to air condition or to use the fan setting, so it got to work immediately.</p><p>It's not a particularly powerful machine, so if you've got a larger room, or you want smarter features, we'd recommend the more expensive AEG Comfort 6000 or the De'Longhi Pinguino.</p><p><strong>Weight:</strong> 28kg <strong>Power</strong>: 2.5KW <strong>Noise level</strong>: 63dB <strong>Dimensions</strong>: 70.3 x 35.5 x 34.5cm <strong>Warranty</strong>: Three years</p><h2>Midea MPPFA-09CRN7</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Capture.jpg><p><strong>Rating:</strong> 3/5</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Good value, easy to set-up</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Lacks power</p><ul><li><strong>Midea Comfee 9000 BTU WiFi Compatible Portable Air Conditioner, £398.95 at Airconcentre - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>In our experience, Midea makes solid air conditioners that are good value, but they don't always feel as premium as their more expensive cousins.</p><p>To start with, this model was very easy to set up and get our heads around.</p><p>It's pretty simple to plug it in, connect the extractor hose and put it out a window, and get it working.</p><p>Once it's on, simply set the temperature and let it get to work.</p><p>In our testing, it reduced a medium-sized room from 25C to 21C in about 90 minutes, which isn't bad, but also isn't as fast as some of the other options on this list.</p><p>This model features smart connectivity, so if you download the app, you can control it from other rooms.</p><p>It's a useful feature and means you need one less remote control lying around the place.</p><p>The model we tested came with a window installation kit, which means you'd get less hot air entering from the open window you're using for your AC's extractor hose.</p><p>Our window wasn't compatible with it though, so we didn't get a chance to test it.</p><p>It also has a heat feature, but given we were living in a heat wave during testing, we didn't give this a go!</p><p>In all, this AC unit will do the job, but it lacks some bells and whistles.</p><p><strong>Weight:</strong> 26.3kg<strong> Power:</strong> 1KW <strong>Noise level:</strong> 65dB <strong>Dimensions</strong>: 72.0 x 43.5 x 34.2 cm <strong>Warranty</strong>: Three years</p><h2>Best air conditioner for extra features: We tried – Evapolar evaLIGHT Plus Air Conditioner</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screenshot-2021-08-18-at-11-54-44-02-webp-WEBP-Image-1803-×-1803-pixels-–-Scaled-33.png><ul><li><strong>Evapolar evaLIGHT Plus Air Conditioner, £169.90 from Amazon- <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>The evaLIGHTplus is Evapolar's best-selling evaporative air cooler and is jam-packed with nifty extras: we're talking a 1000ml removable water tank, sleep timer, touch screen, control wheel and a larger coverage area of up to 3m².</p><p>We were looking for something effective yet compact that would keep a home office cool on hot days without consuming crazy amounts of energy. The evaLIGHTplus has an electricity consumption of 10W, which,&nbsp; considering your average fan uses anything from 30W, it's a cost-effective way of cooling down.</p><p>Our unit arrived securely packaged, and once we'd opened it up, filled the tank with water and plugged it in, we were impressed by how easy it was to get going.</p><p>A control wheel allows you to adjust the airflow, for which there are 10 settings. The highest one was a little too loud for our liking but definitely blasts out icy cool air that would be super refreshing on a hot summer's day. We found we struck a happy medium with the fifth setting, which was quiet enough not to distract us while still being cool and refreshing.</p><p>Appearance-wise, the device is compact, measuring just 20 x 20 x 25cm and we love that the unit sat neatly on our desk without being too much of an eyesore, while the LED light is a lovely touch and there are a selection of colours to choose between.</p><p>If you're looking for a unit you can carry with you from room to room and feel instantly cooled down, we wouldn't hesitate in recommending this nifty little air cooler.</p><p><strong>Weight: </strong>1.27kg<strong> Power: </strong>5W&nbsp;<strong>Noise level: </strong>25dB<strong> Dimensions: </strong>18 x 18cm&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>What’s the difference between an air conditioning unit and an air cooler?</strong></h2><p>There are a few differences between air conditioning units and air coolers, so it’s good to know what these are before buying, that way you can ensure you’re getting the best product for your needs.</p><p>Air conditioners cool the air, lowering the temperature of the room, but they also lower the humidity, so can be drying, whereas air coolers add humidity to the air.</p><p>Air coolers use cold water or ice to cool the air, but air conditioners use cooling gas; both use <a href=# rel=noopener>fans</a> to spread the air around the room.</p><p>Air conditioners must be vented so they can get rid of the hot air, for example via a pipe through the window, whereas air coolers don’t need to be vented.</p><p>If you want to lower the temperature in the room by more than a few degrees then you need an air conditioner; similarly, if your room is large, then an air cooler probably won’t work very well.</p><p>Air coolers use less power than air conditioners, but energy-efficient air conditioners are widely available so check out their rating before buying.</p><p>Finally, air coolers tend to be cheaper, but the best air conditioning units should last you for years, seeing you through many UK summers.</p><h2><strong>Where to buy portable air conditioners in the UK</strong></h2><p>Air conditioners are stocked by a variety of retailers on and off-line, both specialist and more general stores, or try the brand websites themselves if you are drawn to a particular brand.</p><p>Spring is probably the best time of year to start looking for the best air conditioner for you because if you wait until the inevitable <a href=# rel=noopener>summer heatwave</a>, then they’re likely to be hard to find as they sell out quickly.</p><p>Check out retailers such as:</p><h2>Which brand of air conditioner is best?</h2><p>Leading brands like AEG, De'Longhi and LG are all well-known for delivering excellent cooling results and have serious authority in the appliance world.</p><p>However, lesser-known companies and specific air-con specialists can produce results that are just as good, if not better than big-name brands.</p><p>It's advisable to research the market and shop around to find the air conditioner that's right for you and your needs.</p><h2>What is the best air conditioner for home use?</h2><p>There are generally two types of air conditioner to choose from: a wall-mounted split-unit air conditioner, which is perfect for rooms that are always hot as they can't be moved, or standalone portable units that can be shifted from room to room depending on your needs.</p><p>Split-air units are generally more efficient and better at cooling but are more expensive.</p><p>Portable units tend to be cheaper and bulkier, but if your house needs cooling in multiple rooms during the summer they can be carried from room to room. A portable air conditioner is perfect for home use in the UK.</p><h2>What is the best portable air conditioner?</h2><p>The best portable air conditioners on the market right now are light and compact – ideal if you don't have a lot of space to play with.</p><p>Leading models can powerfully and quickly cool down a room without draining too much energy.</p><p>They're also as quiet as can be, so you can go about your day to day life with minimal disruption, or sleep soundly if it's on in your bedroom at night.</p><p>Many newer air conditioners are WiFi-enabled, so you can control them via your phone, a handy extra that means you can get your house cooling down before you've even stepped inside.</p><h2>How much does an air conditioner cost?</h2><p>Portable air conditioning units are far cheaper than investing in getting central air conditioning installed, and far easier to get up and running.</p><p>It is worth shopping around to see what deals can be found and how much an individual air conditioner costs will depend on many factors, including size and power. We've found that most options cost upwards of £300 (see our guide above) but mini options may be found for cheaper.</p><p>It is also worth considering the cost of running your air conditioner; it soon adds up over the summer months. Power consumption will vary depending on the cooling capacity of the unit, but make sure you take these additional electricity costs into account.</p><h2>How do portable air conditioners work?</h2><p>Portable air conditioners work by pulling the hot air from the room and into the unit. Then, the motor inside the air conditioners cools the previously hot air ready to be circulated throughout the room.</p><p>The unit also pushes any warm air and excess moisture out through a hose and out the window (you will need to have a window within reach for the machine to work properly).</p><h2>What size air conditioner do I need?</h2><p>What size air conditioner you opt for depends on a variety of factors, one of them being the price you're willing to pay.</p><p>When it comes to cooling your home, the air conditioner you choose will come down to the size of the room needing to be cooled and how hot the space you're planning on cooling is (from factors such as computers and people).</p><p>If you want to be really specific, you can work out how many BTUs (British Thermal Units) your air conditioner requires to cool your office or room. There are handy calculators that can help you work this out online — we found one at <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">www.aircondirect.co.uk.</a></p><h2>Do you need to clean your air conditioner?</h2><p>Yes! Or, more specifically, you need to make sure you clean the filter inside your air conditioner.</p><p>The filters inside the units are designed to catch dust so if they are not cleaned regularly they can become clogged, collect moisture and may even become mouldy.</p><p>If you want a more thorough job, you could also pay a professional to service your machine.</p><h2>How long do air conditioners work?</h2><p>The durability of your portable air conditioning unit will depend on the model and how well you look after it.</p><p>However, they can last a long time. Good quality, well-looked-after units are able to last for five to 10 years.</p><p>How often you use your air conditioner will also have an impact on how long it works for and, with us Brits usually only making use of them during the summer months, this time could be stretched out.</p><h2>How to clean an air conditioner</h2><p>You can use a vacuum cleaner for cleaning the access panels and filters - ideally using the soft brush attachment to remove dust balls and debris that's gathered in the unit.</p><p>You can also wipe down the inside surfaces of the air conditioning unit with a damp cloth and a small amount of diluted beach solution or washing up liquid.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqysp2Wjmrmmr9OsZmppaGd9cYWSaJmeq6Rirqq%2BjJymp5yZqbawusSrZg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./allie-woods-jake-abel-engaged.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Allie Woods &amp;amp; Jake Abel Engaged  The Host Star Is Off The Market  Hollywood Life">&larr;
