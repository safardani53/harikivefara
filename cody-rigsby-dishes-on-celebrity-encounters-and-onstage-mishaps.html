I don’t think you can love yourself without loving the darker and vulnerable parts of you,” Rigsby says in the new issue of Us Weekly. “That’s why I approached [my memoir] in that way of serious — but a lot of fun as well.”</p><p><strong>In the book, you share your coming out journey. Why was that important for you to include?</strong><br>There are still people who are holding back who they are, [so] I hope… [it] inspires them to live their authenticity — or if there is maybe [someone] with an LGBTQ, brother, sister, mom, dad, and they haven’t quite come to terms with it, that it helps them process it as well.</p><p><strong>You got your start as a backup dancer for <a href=#>Luann de Lesseps</a>. What was that like?</strong><br>I was just so excited to be making $600 and finally say that I was a professional dancer. We were literally on a back porch, and there were fake dollars involved because “Money Can’t Buy You Class”! We did most of the work — and so did Auto-Tune, if you know what I’m saying.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Cody-Rigsby-dishes-on-his-new-memoir-wild-celebrity-encounters-and-onstage-mishaps-1.jpg><p><strong>What was your big break?</strong><br>The Victoria Secret Fashion Show [in 2011]. I got to dance for <strong><a href=#>Katy Perry</a></strong> and <a href=#><strong>Nicki Minaj</strong></a>. It was something that I dreamed of, working for these big artists and doing these big productions. It really was validating.</p><p><strong>Have you ever had an onstage mishap?</strong><br>My <a href=#><strong>Kat Graham</strong></a> performance. Nothing to do with her. She was fantastic. I actually felt so bad because literally it was just something in me. It was this club performance. She had a bunch of record execs and important people coming, and I just could not remember the choreography. I kept failing and failing and no matter how hard I tried, I could not get it. I was so embarrassed. And maybe that’s why Kat’s music career didn’t really take off.</p><p><strong>You’re a huge <a href=#>Britney Spears</a> fan. You auditioned to be her backup dancer, right?</strong><br>I remember flying out to L.A. because the Las Vegas residency was going to happen. I was so, so nervous. I really wanted it but didn’t get my hopes up too much. I knew what the dance industry was about. I got through that first day of auditions and they called me back for the second day so I was feeling a little bit more confident. I was like, “Maybe Brittany will be there.” She wasn’t. And then I got cut on the second day, so I didn’t meet Brittany. But it was a great experience and the residency turned out to be fantastic.</p><p><strong>Best celeb encounter over the years?</strong><br>[<a href=#><strong>Pink</strong></a>] asked me to host her album release party. I had recently gotten back with my boyfriend; we’d taken a little hiatus. I [asked her for] words of advice because I knew that <a href=#>she and her husband had taken a break</a> [years ago]. She was like, “Whatever happened in that six months — whoever you slept with, whoever they slept with … let it go … enjoy what you have.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Cody-Rigsby-dishes-on-his-new-memoir-wild-celebrity-encounters-and-onstage-mishaps-inline.jpg><p><strong>You competed on Dancing With the Stars with <a href=#>Cheryl Burke</a> in 2021. Did you guys get along?</strong><br>Cheryl was a great partner. We once in a while would clash, but I think it always came from a place of love. I think that she always wanted to make me work harder or get it and be the best version of myself. I kind of relate with that in a very similar space.</p><p><strong>You talk about being a sounding board for her during that time. Did you know that her marriage to <a href=#>Matthew Lawrence</a> was on the rocks while filming?</strong><br>I could tell there was a little disconnect. To finish the season and her be like, this has been a great distraction, but I’ve got to figure out what I’m going to do with my relationship — I’m proud of her for <a href=#>choosing herself … and deciding to separate</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Cody-Rigsby-dishes-on-his-new-memoir-wild-celebrity-encounters-and-onstage-mishaps-inline-feature.jpg><p><strong>What did you think of working alongside <a href=#>Tyra Banks</a>?</strong><br>Listen. [I’m an] America’s Next Top Model stan! And I remember the first week of Dancing With the Stars walking down the hallway and Tyra going, “Oh my God, is that Cody Rigsby?” And I was like, “Oh my god. Tyra Banks knows my name!” So I love Tyra and I [loved] her looks, even if they were crazy on the show. The fandom though for Dancing With the Stars doesn’t necessarily love her.</p><p><strong>Thoughts on <a href=#>Julianne Hough</a> taking her <a href=#>hosting spot on the upcoming season</a>?</strong><br>I think everybody loves Julianne. She’s gorgeous. She’s beautiful. She’s going to be a great host. So I invite the change. Listen, Tyra’s going to be fine. She’s got money [in the] bank.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong>How has Peloton changed your life?</strong><br>People [say] that I’ve inspired them or I’ve helped them. I think it’s a very reciprocal relationship. It’s allowed me to find myself, love myself and, most importantly, find my purpose.</p><p>For more on Rigsby’s memoir, watch the video above and pick up the latest issue of Us Weekly, on newsstands now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacp5SuerO1xqyZsmWUnsCpsdJmpqdlk5q5pq7RoquyZZWjsLDBza2cq6tdlrulec6nqq2Zl5p6rrXSoZipq18%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./erica-mena-says-kourtney-kardashian-is-a-role-model.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Erica Mena Says Kourtney Kardashian is a &amp;quot;Role Model&amp;quot;">&larr;
