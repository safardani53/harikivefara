"Is she naturally violent? No. But I will say that Amber is very, very tough to bring down once she’s crossed a certain threshold."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/11/amber-reacts.png><p>"When Amber gets past a certain point even just during an argument, she’s going to say things, horrible things. You’re going to hear things you don’t want anyone ever saying to you."</p><p>What a catch, right?</p><p>"But personally," he added, "I never saw her at that level of anger for more than about 15 minutes. Once it’s over, it’s over and it would be like nothing ever happened."</p><p>When asked directly, he refused to admit that she’d ever hit him, instead saying "I think what people are looking for is her pattern or history [of violence] and you don’t need me for that."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Because she assaulted Gary Shirley on Teen Mom back in the day, remember?</p><p>But Matt also wanted to make sure that everyone knows how good a mother she is.</p><p>"It’s only my perspective," he admitted, "and I haven’t been around to see her with James. But I saw her with Leah."</p><p>"True, Leah wasn’t around all that much, but I never once saw Amber even raise her voice to Leah."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>It feels like in all this he’s trying to say that he doesn’t buy Andrew’s story because he’d only ever seen her be sweet with Leah, but us Teen Mom fans know that that definitely wasn’t always the case.</p><p>Amber had an extremely difficult time caring for Leah when she was a baby, and raising her voice around her was all she ever did.</p><p>Like, CPS got involved because she once assaulted Gary in front of Leah, so it’s really not a stretch to think that she could have assaulted Andrew in front of James.</p><p>But back to Matt.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Later in the interview, he said that after hearing about her arrest, "I texted her and wanted her to know I was thinking about her, and that she is strong and this will pass."</p><p>"I didn’t hear back from her and didn’t expect to."</p><p>On the topic of Amber’s medications and Andrew’s statement in the court documents about how she sometimes refused to take them, Matt acknowledged that "There were times for sure that she didn’t take her meds as scheduled."</p><p>"But — and I want this to be clear — when I was with her, she was still working out what meds were right for her."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>He also said "I did read something recently that said she didn’t want to take her meds because she wanted to drink, but I never saw her do anything like that while we were together."</p><p>"Also," he continued, "I’ve never seen Amber do drugs, ever. I would be shocked if I heard that drugs ended up being involved."</p><p>"She also wasn’t a big drinker when I knew her. Her take on it was that she could separate her addictions."</p><p>Next, he addressed the rumors that he’s only talking about her in interviews because now that Andrew seems to be out of the picture, he wants to weasel his way back in.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>"Um … no," he said. "I love my life and I love my current relationship and wouldn’t give it up for the world. I have the best relationship."</p><p>Matt also mentioned that "Amber’s biggest fear is going back to prison," and "Her second biggest fear, in my opinion, is having people think she hasn’t changed."</p><p>Seems like her second biggest fear has already come true, but that first one?</p><p>She’s due back in court today, so we’ll just have to see on that one.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Andrew Glennon Responds to Amber Portwood: Enjoy Your Pity Party, Loser!</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pxX2WEcLnAratmmpGesrN5wKaZnqpdpbyzwNaopp1lnZbGbq7EZq2ip5yau7V5wKebZpmSqsCqwsRmma6sXai1pr%2BMpKBo</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./gray-davis-19421226-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Gray Davis (Politician) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More">&larr;
