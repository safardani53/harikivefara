Further, he has three siblings Jeff, Rebecca, and Melissa Marchand.</p><p>Brad is the oldest of them all. His parents are both local hockey coaches proving hockey does run in his blood.</p><p>As a kid, he was a short-tempered kid who used to get into fights often. Marchand even developed an aggressive game-playing style that suited his temper.</p><p>However, it would be a nightmare for his opponents as he has hit an opponent to the extent that damaged the cage on the player’s helmet.</p><p>As a result, the skater had to take anger management classes frequently. Furthermore, as his hockey career progressed, he also visited a sports psychologist.</p><p>Despite his on-ice behavior, he knew precisely how to convert his anger into scores as he was a prolific scorer.</p><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>You Might Be Interested In Ice-Hockey Player,&nbsp;</span></strong><a href=# rel=noopener><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Olli Juolevi Bio: NHL, News, Injury & Contract >></span></strong></a></p><h2>Brad Marchand | Age, Height, And Weight</h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The Bruins player recently turned </span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>35–</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>years old on May 11</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>, </span>2024<span data-preserver-spaces=true>.</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true> As an athlete, Marchand stays on top of his health.<br></span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Hence, he is very fit and has a toned physique.

Similarly, he had exceptional skills to back off his talk as well.</p><p>Therefore,&nbsp;the Moncton Wildcats of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) drafted him as the 24th overall.</p><p>Instantly, he clicked with the team as he scored 29 goals in his rookie year. Hence, his performance got him the QMJHL Rookie of the Year award.</p><p>Likewise, he made significant progress as he received the go-to role on the team. Thus, Marchand scored 29 goals and 66 points in the regular season.</p><p>Further, he toned up his level in the postseason that allowed him to lead his team to the President’s Cup.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Brad_Marchand_QMJHL.jpg><p>Despite the players’ outstanding performance, the team lost the finals to the Quebec Remparts.</p><p>Seeing such a phenomenal young player make a name for himself, the NHL’s Boston Bruins couldn’t resist drafting the young man.</p><p>As a result, the Bruins spent a lot of draft picks acquiring Marchand’s draft rights as the 71st overall pick in 2006.</p><p>However, Brad still stayed in QMJHL before being eligible to play in the NHL. Hence, he spends two more seasons in the junior league playing for Val-d’Or Foreurs and Halifax Mooseheads.</p><h3>NHL</h3><h4>Summer Camp and NHL Debut</h4><p>After not having a productive year in the QMJHL, Boston asked Marchand to join the summer training camp.</p><p>Further, Marchand didn’t like this decision as he wanted to play in the big league rather than a training camp.</p><p>Despite his feelings, he still had to join Boston’s American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate Providence Bruins. He made sure to work his way up to the NHL.</p><p>Therefore, the player finished with eight goals and 41 assists in 79 games which helped the team get into the 2009 Calder Cup playoffs, where they were eliminated.</p><p>Moreover, after showcasing some brilliant offensive games, Marchand received his first call-up by the Boston Bruins and made his debut on October 21, 2009.</p><p>However, he couldn’t keep up with the hype as he went scoreless for 11 games straight. Hence, he was sent back to Providence, where he is the put in more effort.</p><p>Furthermore, the Bruins played him as the fourth-line forward, which seemed to be a splendid decision. By the All-Star break, he had scored 13 goals and 25 points.</p><h4>First Playoffs, Contract Extension, and First Career Hatrick</h4><p>Getting into NHL for the second time, Marchand sought out to make a name for himself. Further, with the given opportunity, he made sure to put out an offensive display.</p><p>Therefore, he helped the team get into the 2011 Stanely Cup playoffs, where he remained scorching hot on the offensive end.</p><p>The rookie player recorded 19 points in 25 postseason games that helped Boston claim the championship.</p><p>Not to mention, his 11 playoff goals lead him to tie Jeremy Roenick for the second-most of any NHL rookie.</p><p>Seeing his fantastic performance throughout the season, the Bruins re-signed Marchand for two years.</p><p>Overall, he had a very productive season despite Boston failing to have a deep postseason run. However, the NHL team knew that Marchand was a suitable investment.</p><p>Therefore, the Bruins extended his contract for four years on September 7, 2012.</p><p><strong>Learn more about NHL player&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Evgeny Svechnikov Bio: Ice Hockey, Career & Net Worth >></a></strong></p><h4>Injury, First All-Star Team, and Max Contract Extension</h4><p>For a player not to get injured is quite rare in competitive sports, especially for Marchand, who are overly energetic during game time.</p><p>Hence, in the 2014 Playoffs, he received an elbow injury that concluded not to be serious. However, it did seem to through off his balance now and then in games.</p><p>Similarly, he suffered a concussion in the 2015-16 season due to a collision with Dale Weise. As a result, the collision sidelined him indefinitely.</p><p>Shortly after missing two games, he returned to the active roster. The Bruins’ struggle on the offensive end continued as they missed playoffs for the second time.</p><p>Nonetheless, they were very clear about their future with Marchand as he developed into a star player.</p><p>Therefore, Boston offered him a <strong>$49 million</strong> max-contract extension of eight years. On top of that, the same season, Marchand made it into his first NHL All-Star Game.</p><p>Not to mention, by that time, he was leading the Bruins in scoring. He put up 13 goals and 22 assists in 43 games.</p><p>Likewise, the NHL player also received the Elizabeth C. Dufresne Trophy as the most outstanding player for the <span class=ILfuVd><span class=hgKElc>Boston Bruins</span></span>.</p><h4>Unsuccessful Playoff Run</h4><p>Despite the Bruins’ best effort, they never seem to catch a break for performing well in the postseason.</p><p>Except for Marchand’s rookie year with the team, the team has failed season after season in capturing the trophy.</p><p>Marchand is tremendous reliability on the offensive end. However, without a good player surrounding him, there is not much that the left-winger can do.</p><p>Nevertheless, he is still fired up to make another deep playoff run and reclaim the Stanley Cup again.</p><h2>Suspensions and Fine</h2><p>You would think Brad is known for his superb on-ice performance. That is true to some extent, but he is famous for his behavior issues.</p><p>He is highly competitive, and when things don’t go his way, he doesn’t shy off to express his feeling towards his opponent. Thus, he has been suspended six-time in his career.&nbsp;</p><p>In the 2010-11 season, he first received his two-game suspension for elbowing R. J. Umberger.</p><p>Further, he continued his behavior on the ice, trying to fight with opponents and perform an illegal move.</p><p>As a result, Brad was given the nickname “<strong>pest</strong>” due to his reputation of getting under his opponent’s skin.</p><p>Indeed, the Bruins loved his attitude as he would disrupt <span class="sc-1d8dc42-1 ibmLGk">competitors’</span> rhythm. Nevertheless, such behaviors were not tolerated by the league.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/marchand-licking.jpg><p>Therefore, he received multiple fines for his action on-ice. For example, he was fined over $150,000 in the 2011-12 season for an illegal hit to the head.</p><p>Similarly, he received a fine of $5,000 for throwing a punch with a two-game suspension and over $150,000 for repeatedly offending the league rule with a three-game suspension.</p><p>Nevertheless, there are rumorous instances where he violated the league’s rule. However, one that stood out was his habit of kissing and licking his opponents.</p><p>Such action was first noticed in the 2017 season, where he leaned to kiss Leo Komarov on the cheek instead of fighting.</p><p>Likewise, the Canadian skater licked Ryan Callahan during the 2018 second round of playoffs, for which he received a warning.</p><p>Overall, if he keeps up his attitude, he could undoubtedly set the record for the highest number of suspensions in NHL history.</p><h2>Brad Marchand | Dating, Marriage, And Kids</h2><p>Brad Marchand is married to his long-term girlfriend, <a href=# rel=noopener>Katrina Sloane</a>, in September of 2015. They had dated for five years before tying knots with each other.</p><p>They are a thrilling couple with two children.
