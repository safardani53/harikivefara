At the age of 21, her current condition - lack of natural skills and behaviour - does not allow her to be placed in other types of enclosures.</p><p>"We do hope that she might be able to get a chance to live on the sanctuary island someday.</p><p>"In the&nbsp;complex&nbsp;she is staying in, Pony always shows a healthy appetite&nbsp;for&nbsp;fruits and enrichment tools that our team gives her."</p><p>The Sun Online previously spoke to the orangutan experts who helped rescue and look after Pony, and investigated the illegal ape trafficking trade - where primates are sold for up to £10,000 via the black market.<br></p><h2>Covered in abscesses in 'brothel village'</h2><p><span>No one knows exactly how long Pony was forced to work as a prostitute before being rescued from a brothel in </span><span>Indonesia.</span></p><p>It's taken over a decade for Pony to recover from the unimaginable cruelty she suffered at the&nbsp; “brothel” village - a destination popular with local farm workers.</p><p><span>Chained to a bed, men could choose to pay to have sex with her - and she was regularly shaved and made to wear perfume and jewellery.</span></p><p><span>Former teacher Michelle&nbsp;Desilets started volunteering looking after orphaned orangutans in Borneo in 1994&nbsp; and&nbsp;</span><span>was director of Borneo Orangutan Survival Foundation UK when Pony was rescued.</span></p><p><span>She told The Sun Online: “It was horrifying. She was a sex slave - it was grotesque. She was covered in abscesses, and they put make-up and earrings on her.</span></p><p><span>“She must have been in so much pain. It was horrible to think about how terrified she must have been.”</span></p><p><span>Danish conservationist Lone Droscher-Nielsen was part of the team who rescued Pony in 2003.</span></p><p><span>She said: “When I found that she was used for prostitution and not just a pet I was horrified.</span></p><p><span>“Perhaps in my naivety I had never thought it humanly possible to do such a thing to an animal.”</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT0004519481821.jpg><h2>35 armed police to the rescue</h2><p><span>The rescue wasn’t straightforward, with the local community extremely reluctant to let Pony, who was a good source of income, go.</span></p><p><span>In the end it took 35 armed policemen to get the villagers to hand over Pony.</span></p><p><span>Michelle says: “They were threatened with guns and knives.</span></p><p><span>“The madam cried bitterly when Pony was taken away.”</span></p><p><span>At the point of rescue, as well as the psychological trauma, Pony was in a horrific condition physically. Her skin was infected, and she couldn’t stop scratching.</span></p><p><span>Michelle says: “I met Pony shortly after she was rescued. Her resilience is amazing. Despite the trauma, she maintained a dignity, and sense of humour. She had the best personality, and learned how to trust very quickly, despite what she’d been through.”</span></p><h2><b>Terrified of men</b></h2><p><span>Experts think she'd been taken from her mother as an infant, as most orangutans usually stay with their mum for the first seven to 11 years of their lives - and they estimated her to be around six years old.</span></p><p><span>Lone explains: “The first baby steps where to make her trust us in her new home.</span></p><p><span>“We tried to keep men away from her enclosure as she was afraid of them.</span></p><p><span>“After her quarantine we would take her into the forest with the younger orangutans, still women only.</span></p><p><span>“As she improved, male carers were slowly introduced to her. She didn't seem to be afraid of them anymore and she was happy with any company she could have. Eventually she was moved to one of the islands.”</span></p><p><span>Sadly, due to her lack of survival skills and the fact she’d spent too much time in human captivity, she’ll never be released back into the wild.</span></p><p><span>However now, 15 years on, she is in good health, and lives in an enclosure in Nyaru Menteng Rehabilitation Centre with seven</span><span>&nbsp;other orangutans - and has learned how to make nests and forage.</span></p><h2>Trafficked apes for £10k on social media</h2><p><span>While Pony’s situation is very rare, tragically factors including deforestation and illegal trafficking of these primates - who can weigh up to 21st and live up to 50 years old - mean they may soon be extinct.</span></p><p><span>It is thought around 1,000 orangutans - whose name literally translates into English as “person of the forest” - are killed every year so their babies can be sold on the black market</span><i><span>. </span></i><span>For every one orangutan baby sold, it is thought &nbsp;at least four others are killed.</span></p><p><span>Disturbingly, it’s all too easy to sell or buy an ape like Pony.</span></p><p><span>Reports suggest the illegal wildlife trade is booming, thanks to social media platforms such as Instagram and Facebook.</span></p><p><span>Michelle adds: “There’s nothing cuter than a baby orangutan. That’s their flaw - they’re irresistible as babies so they fetch a lot of money and celebrities like Paris Hilton have been pictured posing with them on Instagram.</span><span><br></span><span>“However, they don’t make good pets - they become unmanageable.”</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT0004519481681.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT0004519471811.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT0004519471821.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT0004519481621.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT0004519471801.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>Amazing moment an orangutan attacks a mechanical digger trying to destroy its jungle home in Borneo</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfbIVzhZBucGiooqTAtbXTrqueZZ%2Bnrq%2Bz1K2Yp2WgpLu6edOrmKChk2LAtbvRsmY%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./cheltenham-festival-gold-cup-dawn-run.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Number 9: The legendary mare who completed the Champion Hurdle-Gold Cup double in the 80's">&larr;
