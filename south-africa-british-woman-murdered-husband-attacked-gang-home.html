After I stood up, I heard glass breaking.</p><p>"I suppose that is when they started shooting at us. I assumed they missed.&nbsp;&nbsp;They were wearing balaclavas and attacked us."</p><p>Mr Lynn was pistol whipped and ordered to lie down.</p><p>He said: "They kept on asking where the money is. I told them that we don’t keep money but they would not believe me."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/suevenster-520x400.jpg><p>Mr Lynn gave them a couple of hundred Rand he had in a money clip and his bank cards.</p><p>Shortly after his attackers started burning him with a blow torch on his chest and legs.</p><p>His hands were tied with twine and the robbers then started cutting him with a knife in order to get him to confess to keeping more money or a gun safe somewhere.</p><p>He said: "They were looking for things we just don’t have.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/kh-map-dullstroom.jpg><p>"I said to them that whoever gave them their information, gave them the wrong information. One of them replied with 'No they didn't'."</p><p>Mr Lynn kept on calling to his wife in the bedroom but said she did not answer.</p><p>He said: "The small dark one, who seemed to be the leader, smacked me over the head with his gun and told me to shut up."</p><p>Mr Lynn was put in the back of their Nissan pickup&nbsp;and his attackers pulled a black bag over his head.</p><p>He said: "I suppose they wanted to suffocate me but I managed to bite a tiny hole through the bag through which I could breathe."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/nintchdbpict000304009194.jpg><p>He heard his wife moaning as she was thrown into the&nbsp;back of the pickup.</p><p>The attackers struggled for a while to reverse the vehicle out of the parking bay.</p><p>He said: "I thought we were going to Dullstroom to withdraw money. But then they turned towards Belfast."</p><p>The attackers drove on back roads through Belfast and Siyathuthuka and onto the road towards Stoffberg.</p><p>He said: "They kept on stopping and going and when they stopped for good they pulled me out of the vehicle by my hair."</p><p>The robbers walked him into the field, where he had to crawl through a barbed wire fence and was ordered to get on his knees.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/nintchdbpict000301823478-e1487845099454.jpg><p>He said: "That was the last thing I remember. I thought I was dead after that until I looked up and saw the stars."</p><p>It took Mr Lynn some time to free his hands, after he crawled back to the road.</p><p>He said: "When I got to the road, something told me to turn right. But left made more sense because it was downhill. I turned right.</p><p>"I was not steady on my feet so I crawled most of the way. I thought I heard a cow mooing. Later I realised that it was Susan moaning.</p><p>"I crossed the road, crawling most of the way. On the other side I saw Susan, lying in a ditch. Her hands tied behind her back. She was bleeding from her head.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/midmed.jpg><p>"I didn’t know what to do. I could see that she was in a very bad state. I could sit with her but the best thing would be to try and get help.</p><p>"So I stood next to the road. Five trucks and two cars passed me hooting their horns as they did but they did not stop."</p><p>His saviours were two friends who drove by&nbsp;as dawn broke.</p><p>Devastated Mr Lynn said: "Susan was a great girl. She had a great life - just to end up in a ditch with her hands tied behind her back."</p><p>It was the third violent farm attack in the province this month.</p><p>Border collie lover Sue was extremely well known in sheepdog trial circles and had three rescue dogs of her own.</p><p>Provincial police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathis&nbsp;said: "They were sleeping on Sunday when they were attacked by three men. This was a violent and horrific attack and we are searching for those responsible."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/nintchdbpict000005227198.jpg><p>The couple's&nbsp;blue Nissan pickup truck&nbsp;was found abandoned in Middleburg.</p><p>Susan&nbsp;moved to Dullstroom in 1996 and started the Dullstroom Stables before the farm Marchlands where she was attacked became her home.</p><p>She passed away in the Midmed Hospital on Tuesday morning never regaining consciousness after the attack.</p><p>Her ashes will be flown to Southsea in England where she will be buried with her parents. She was an only child.</p><p>Meanwhile Robert Lynn says he will try to pick up the pieces in Dullstroom.</p><p>He said: "I am amazed how good people have been to me.&nbsp;&nbsp;But I will never be able to forget what evil people are capable of."</p><p>Close friend Claire Taylor invited local paper the Middleburg Observer into the hospital to photograph Sue in bed to show the full horror of what local farmers are going through.</p><p>She said at the time: "Sue is&nbsp;such a powerful person.&nbsp; She is so strong.&nbsp; She is straight shooter.</p><p>"She would have wanted the world to see&nbsp;what happened to her. What they did to her."</p><p>Before settling in Dullstroom, Sue was at the head of a pharmaceutical company in Johannesburg.&nbsp; She kept her maiden hame after marrying&nbsp;Robert&nbsp;who was an electrical engineer for Eskom.</p><p>A reward is being put together by friends&nbsp;of the couple to try and track down their evil attackers.</p><p>A spokesman for the Democratic Alliance said yesterday: "Sue and husband Robert were overpowered and tortured and left left for dead.</p><p>“<a href=#>Since the beginning of February 30 farms have have been attacked and 15 people have lost their lives in farm attacks</a> across the country.</p><p>"We simply cannot allow these horrendous acts to continue and or our rural communities to live in fear.</p><p>"We call on the Government to employ rural safety units to protect rural communities from rural crime."</p><p>A close friend of Sue’s told a local paper: "She had a heart of gold who made a strong impression on people wherever she went.</p><p>"Robert will be devastated at her loss. This is just horrific and it what happened was just pure and hateful and pointless torture."</p><p>Col. Phela Mahlangu, head of the detectives at the Middelburg Cluster, said that a task team has been established to work on the case around the clock.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ4Z0gZBuaGirn6rBqXnAn6mim5Fir7O106KqoWWnpLqiuoymrKuclaeypXnHrqqbmZ6ZeqLA05qapJ2UYrSiusZmn6illWQ%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./k-michelle-slams-angela-yee-radio-host-the-breakfast-club-interview.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="I Aint F***ing With You  Hollywood Life">&larr;
