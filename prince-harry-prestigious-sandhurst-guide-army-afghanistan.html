for the military ­academy’s definitive book of 200 people to serve there — despite brother <a href=#>William</a> penning the foreword.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2006-officer-cadet-h-wales-3932070.jpg> <img

means he joins outcasts such as fascist leader <a href=#>Sir Oswald Mosley</a> and Waffen-SS Officer Benson Freeman among “traitors and cads” to be omitted.</p><p>He even lost out to You’re Beautiful singer<a href=#> James Blunt</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>It comes after Harry committed the cardinal sin of <a href=#>boasting about his kills</a> in his memoir <a href=#>Spare </a>and abandoning <a href=#>Queen </a>and country to set up home in <a href=#>California</a>.</p><p>Former British <a href=#>Army</a> Commander Richard Kemp said he understood the ­decision to snub Harry,&nbsp;adding:&nbsp;“I probably would have included him, on balance, but it is not a disappointment to not see him in there.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE IN ROYALS">READ MORE IN ROYALS</h2><p>"I don’t think he did anything particularly notable during his service but he was certainly a significant person to go to <a href=#>Sandhurst</a>.</p><p>“I suspect the recent disharmony between him and the <a href=#>Royal Family</a> has led them to decide against having him.”</p><p>He went on:&nbsp;“One thing he said in his book was the Army taught him to see the enemy as less than human — which is not what we were taught.&nbsp;</p><p>"That has overshadowed a lot of the great things that he has done.”</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Royals</h2></p><p>In 2005, Harry completed a 44-week training course at the campus in Camberley, <a href=#>Surrey</a>, and passed out as an Officer Cadet the following year.</p><p>But in guide They Also Served: 200 People Who Trained At Sandhurst, author Vaughan Kent-Payne says that “not everybody who trained [there] was a good egg”.</p><p>In a veiled dig at the estranged Prince, the 65-year-old adds that “there is a smattering of traitors and cads”.</p><p>There is only one fleeting mention of Harry in the book — in his brother William’s entry.</p><p>The Prince of <span id=5ec81301-442b-4a21-bebd-64c1aadf808d class=suggested-link>Wales</span> completed the course the year after Harry.</p><p>The passage about William reads: “His status as a future King meant that he could not be deployed on operations like his younger brother, Harry.”</p><p>Other iconic Brits to make the cut include war-time Prime Minister <a href=#>Winston Churchill</a>, astronaut Major <a href=#>Tim Peake</a> and ex-rugby ace Josh Lewsey.</p><p>Mr Kent-Payne is the executive director of The Sandhurst Trust, the official <a href=#>charity</a> and alumni community for the academy.&nbsp;Proceeds from the £28 book will go to the Trust.</p><p>A Sandhurst Spokesperson said: “The book highlights the breadth of accomplishments and experiences across Sandhurst graduates rather than just focusing on the most well-known.”</p><p>It is the latest bitter blow to Harry’s tarnished military career — which saw him do two tours of Afghanistan.</p><p>He is very proud of his time in the Army.</p><p>After training at Sandhurst, Harry was commissioned as an officer in the Household Cavalry Blues and <a href=#>Royals </a>in April 2006.</p><p>In Afghanistan, he acted as a Forward Air Controller from 2007 to 2008 and as an Apache Pilot from 2012 to 2013, and was stationed on occasion at Camp Bastion.&nbsp;</p><p>He witnessed horrific injuries suffered by fellow servicemen&nbsp;and later set up the Invictus Games for wounded personnel.</p><p>During his time in the combat, he qualified as an Apache Aircraft ­Commander and was promoted to the rank of Captain in 2011.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>But he was devastated when he was stripped of his three ceremonial titles in 2021 when he and wife Meghan left royal duty to live in the US.</p><p>Last year, <a href=#>King Charles</a> observed military cadets completing their training at Sandhurst and spoke of how much the military school meant to Harry.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

GALLERY</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Joe Hadden</p><p>A STRING of infamous “old boys” have been airbrushed from Sandhurst.</p><p>Sir Oswald Mosley was expelled for fighting with a fellow student after a polo match in 1914.</p><p>He went on to create the British Union of Fascists and align himself with Hitler and Mussolini.</p><p>Another attender of the elite academy who cosied up to Adolf was ex-RAF officer Benson Freeman — who switched sides during World War Two.</p><p>A host of African coup leaders who earned their stripes at the academy are also left out of the book. They include Nigerian Yakubu Gowon and former Ethiopian head Aman Andom.</p><p>By contrast, those who did get mentioned include wartime PM Winston Churchill who trained there as did You’re Beautiful singer James Blunt and astronaut Tim Peake.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqumspmcqHxzgZFwb2ptZWS9s7XNnJxmoJGnv7p5z6ucrKyZnLawwdJmqpqmlJ3Cs7%2FTZp6uoZSaeqK%2BzLJkmp6Xna6vtdKtmKdn</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./prostitute-orangutan-pony-tragic-story.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Horrifying tale of prostitute orangutan who was chained to a bed, shaved daily and forced to perform">&larr;
