Gemini's intense curiosity drives it to be spontaneous, lively, and wonderfully eccentric. This air sign, appropriately represented by the celestial twins, was so interested in so many things that it had to double itself.</p><p>American actress best known for starring in several blaxploitation films, as well as for her performance as Kit Porter in six seasons of The L Word.
