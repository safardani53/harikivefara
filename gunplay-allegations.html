According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Law and Crime</a>, Vonshae asked the reality star to turn down the volume while he was playing Call of Duty. Gunplay allegedly became irate after hearing the request and began throwing cups and a bottle at Vonshae, who was holding their baby. An arrest report revealed that Gunplay then pressed an AK-47 against Vonshae’s chest and exclaimed, “I will blow your s--- back.”</p><p>Following Gunplay's arrest, Vonshae took to Instagram to share her version of events. “Unfortunately Richard is back to using and developed a very bad drinking problem,” Vonshae wrote. “I’ve tried everything in my power to help him and love him. This is a demon he has to overcome on his own.” The mother of one revealed that she was traumatized by the ordeal but is now “safe.” Vonshae also alleged that Gunplay refused to let her leave the home, but she was eventually able to escape unharmed.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Vonshae further emphasized that she is done with Gunplay and plans to file for divorce.

The rapper along with an associate, Randy Jones, allegedly stole jewelry and a cell phone from the victim before viciously attacking him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The charges against Gunplay were later dropped after the victim, Turron Woodside, refused to cooperate with prosecutors. “As Turron Woodside is the sole proprietor of his tax business, we have no way of getting the video recording of the crime admitted in as evidence without his testimony,” a court memo stated (via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CBS News</a>).</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Gunplay has discussed his substance abuse issues in the past.</h2><p>Gunplay rose to fame in 2013, thanks to his hit “Bible on the Dash,” and has since joined the cast of <a href=#>Love & Hip Hop Miami</a>.
