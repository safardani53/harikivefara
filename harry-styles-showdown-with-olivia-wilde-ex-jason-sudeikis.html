Mine’s going to be like a karaoke, I want that many songs. I even know what velvet I want&nbsp; inside my coffin.</p><p>“I want everyone to be really sad. I don’t want it to be joyous, I want ­people to go, ‘God, we’re really going to miss her.’&nbsp;</p><p>“So I want projectors either side of my coffin playing old episodes of Gogglebox and Saturday Night Takeaway, but just of me laughing in slow motion and looking really joyous so that everyone can go, ‘Look how happy she was’.”</p><h2>Justin's £400k blow</h2><p>JUSTIN and Hailey ­Bieber have sold their ­Beverly Hills mansion – for a £388,000 loss.</p><p>The couple only bought the luxurious property&nbsp; two years ago but&nbsp; have already flogged it for far less than they paid.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/d5e1ff2f-43a4-47d5-abd4-f960bcc2638e.jpg><p>They splashed out £6.06million for the pad&nbsp; in 2019&nbsp; but put it back on the market in October and it recently shifted for £5.66million.</p><p>They offloaded it when they bought another swanky residence for a whopping £18.5million.</p><p>Justin and Hailey are clearly bringing in the big bucks – just not as ­property speculators.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Singles</h3></p><p>1.

Gary has teamed&nbsp; up with Pink Floyd’s touring bassist Guy Pratt, who is a member of Floyd drummer Nick Mason’s&nbsp; Saucerful Of Secrets band.</p><p>Gary said: “I did a record, all remote.</p><p>“Well, a lot of it was remote, apart from in&nbsp; the ­summer when we could meet up.</p><p>“It’s finished and coming out in a few months. I roped Guy in.”</p><p>The news comes after&nbsp; many years of arguments with former ­Spandau singer Tony Hadley, which forced Gary&nbsp; to admit last year: “There are&nbsp; no plans for Spandau going into 2020.”</p><p>I’ve got my fingers crossed his solo efforts fare better this time around.</p><h2>Grim for North</h2><p>IF you think you’ve had a bad week, spare a thought for ­jordan North.</p><p>The Radio 1 DJ and I’m A Celeb finalist ­accidentally binned his phone, lost his wallet and had a letter from the bailiffs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/NINTCHDBPICT000618580234.jpg><p>He said: “It was my birthday on Sunday and I think I’d had a few too many and decided to do the recycling.</p><p>“I couldn’t find my phone all Sunday night. I was there in the bin area near my flats and we had a&nbsp; torch going through the bins like a naughty little fox. I found it in the end.”</p><p>Speaking of his nightmare week, he continued: “I ­forgot to pay a parking fine&nbsp; two years ago and got a letter from the bailiffs. You wouldn’t believe how much the interest is now.”</p><p>If that wasn’t bad enough, Jordan was put in a worse mood yesterday when he weighed himself – a mistake nobody should make in lockdown.</p><p>He said on Radio 1: “I’ve got more rolls than Greggs. After lockdown, no more ­eating like a ten-year- old. I need to grow up.&nbsp; I’m a grown man. It’s nothing short of pathetic.</p><p>“Post-lockdown it’s going to be all grapefruit, kale, and broccoli.”</p><p>I’ll believe it when&nbsp; I see it.</p><p>JESSIE J is teaming up once again with the ­songwriter&nbsp; she penned some of&nbsp; her ­biggest hits with.</p><p>Claude Kelly&nbsp; co-wrote Domino, Price Tag and Wild with the Brit singer, as well as Miley Cyrus’s Party In The USA, and now the talented duo are working together again for her sixth album.</p><p>Claude told me: “Jessie is one of my best friends and she is working on music. Although we are ­separated because of Covid, we have had some writing sessions via Zoom. I don’t know what the final tracklist will be for the album but I do believe we’ve done a few special things that will make it on there.”</p><p>As a music mastermind who has also written major singles for Britney Spears, Whitney Houston and Christina Aguilera, Claude has now ­created his own girl group.</p><p>He said: “I’ve been focused on launching The Shindellas.&nbsp; Think of your favourite girl bands like Destiny’s Child, it’s that ­calibre. I don’t say that lightly, given I’ve worked with some pretty fantastic people. They’re the next big thing.”</p><h2>Toe-tall Nessa</h2><p>SHE has already nailed touching her toes, but ­Nessa ­Barrett will be touching the sky with the release of her new song.</p><p>The US singer has teamed up with Blink-182 drummer Travis Barker and alt-pop star JXDN for La Di Die.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/NINTCHDBPICT000637213327.jpg><p>Speaking about the single, out yesterday, Nessa said: “It touches on how fame is dramatised and something most people wish for, when in reality, it’s a dark and evil place.”</p><p>If you like early Avril Lavigne, you’ll love this.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Bizarre</h2></p><p>ALAN Walker and Salem Ilese’s anthemic collaboration Fake A Smile leads the new music releases this weekend.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Alongside that, Brit SG Lewis has put out his debut album Times and American singer Conan Gray has treated fans to his new ­single Overdrive.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Wendy Williams slams Olivia Wilde, 36, as 'worst mother' for moving in with 'young boy' Harry Styles, 27</span><p><strong>GOT a story?
