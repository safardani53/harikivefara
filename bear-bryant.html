His mother’s name was Ida Kilgore Bryant. Likewise, his Father’s name was Wilson Monroe.</p><p>Bryant was born into a low-income family. His Father, Wilson, was a farmer and his mother, Ida, looked after the family.</p><p>When Bryant was still tiny, his Father became ill. As a result, his mother, Ida, was compelled to run the farm.</p><p>Bryant had a big family. His parents had 12 children altogether. He was the eleventh one.&nbsp;</p><p>Paul’s mother wished for him to become a clergyman. However, Bryant persuaded his mother by telling her that “coaching is a lot like preaching.”</p><p>Bryant began playing football for Fordyce High School as an eighth-grader.

Oxen are used as farming tools in an agricultural society.&nbsp;</p><p>Bryant was born into a low-income family and had a farm, so the Chinese zodiac was quite a fit for Bryant.</p><p>Moreover, the ox zodiac also attaches the symbol of diligence, honesty, and persistence. Bear Bryant was no different.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Bear_Bryant_1977.jpg><p>Through his honest behavior, persistency, and magnetic charisma, Bryant won the hearts of many during his life.</p><p>He was also a legendary figure; people looked to him for inspiration.&nbsp;</p><p>About Bryant’s body measurements, he was 6 feet 1 inch tall when he was 13. He grew up to become 6 feet 4 inches tall as an adult.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, Bryant weighed 180 pounds at the age of thirteen.&nbsp;His other body measurements are not known.&nbsp;</p><p>Bryant had blue eyes and brown hair.

Bryant led Maryland to a 6–2–1 record in his lone season there.</p><p>Harry Clifton “Curley” Byrd was the president and former football coach of Maryland University. However, Bryant and Byrd often clashed with each other.</p><p>The most notable instance occurred when Bryant was on vacation, and Byrd welcomed back a player who Bryant had suspended for breaking team rules.</p><p>Bryant departed Maryland after the 1945 season to become the head coach at Kentucky University.</p><h3>Kentucky</h3><p>Bryant was the head coach at the University of Kentucky for eight years. In 1947, Kentucky made its first bowl appearance.</p><p>Likewise, it won its first Southeastern Conference title in 1950. Both achievements were only possible because of Bryant’s leadership.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, the 1950 Kentucky Wildcats football team ended the season with an 11–1 record, including a Sugar Bowl victory over Bud Wilkinson’s top-ranked Oklahoma Sooners.</p><p>However, after the 1953 season, Bryant quit the job. Bryant believed Adolph Rupp’s basketball team would always be the school’s premier sport despite leading Kentucky’s football team to its highest point.</p><h3>Texas A&M</h3><p>Bryant took the position of head coach at Texas A&M University in 1954. While at Texas A&M, he also served as athletic director.&nbsp;</p><p>In 1954, the Aggies had a dreadful 1–9 season, which began with the notorious training camp in Junction, Texas.</p><p>Two years later, the American coach led the 1956 Texas A&M Aggies to the Southwest Conference title with a 34–21 win against the Texas Longhorns in Austin.</p><p>Bryant’s standout running back, John David Crow, won the Heisman Trophy the following year.</p><p>Likewise, the 1957 Aggies were in championship contention until they fell to the #20 Rice Owls in Houston, speculating that Alabama would pursue Bryant.</p><h3>Alabama</h3><p>Bear Bryant is most widely known as the head coach of Alabama. Bryant coached at Alabama for 25 years.</p><p>During his coaching years, the Alabama team earned six national crowns in 1961, 1964, 1965, 1973, 1978, and 1979. Moreover, they also won thirteen SEC Championships.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Bear-Bryant-Memorial.jpg><p>Furthermore, Bryant’s win over in-state rival Auburn on November 28, 1981, coached by former Bryant assistant Pat Dye, was his 315th head coach.</p><p>It was the most of any head coach at the time. Bear Bryant’s overall coaching record was 323–85–17.</p><h2>Bear Bryant: Medical Condition</h2><p>Bryant smoked and drank heavily throughout his life, deteriorating his health in the late 1970s.</p><p>Bryant went for alcohol treatment after collapsing due to a cardiac crisis in 1977 but only lasted a few months there and resumed drinking.</p><p>Likewise, the American coach had a minor stroke in 1980 that weakened the left side of his body and another cardiac event in 1981.</p><p>Moreover, in his later years, Bryant was on various drugs.</p><p>He met preacher Robert Schuller on a plane journey shortly before his death, and the two chatted extensively about religion, which impacted the coach.&nbsp;</p><p>Bryant felt significant for concealing his smoking and drinking habits from his mother.</p><h3>Death</h3><p>Bryant went to Druid City Hospital in Tuscaloosa on January 25, 1983, after having chest trouble.</p><p>He died a day later after having a massive heart attack while being prepped for an ECG.</p><p>Dr. William Hill, Bryant’s physician, expressed surprise that Bryant had been able to coach the Alabama team to two national titles in his final five years of life, considering his deteriorating health.</p><p>Bert Bank and the N.B.C. Radio Network were the first to report Bryant’s death.</p><h2>Bear Bryant: Controversies</h2><h3>Racism</h3><p>During his days in Alabama, Paul was accused of racism for refusing to recruit black athletes for years.</p><p>Bryant said that the current social milieu and the overwhelming presence in Alabama of known segregationist George Wallace prevented him from doing so.</p><p>However, Bryant eventually persuaded the administration to allow him to do so. As a result, Wilbur Jackson was recruited as Alabama’s first black scholarship player. He signed in the spring of 1970.</p><h3>Defamation Suit</h3><p>Bryant sued The Saturday Evening Post in 1962 for publishing a story by Furman Bisher accusing him of pushing his players to engage in violence during a 1961 game against the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets.</p><p>Six months later, “The Story of a College Football Rig” was published in the magazine, accusing Bryant and Wally Butts of scheming to fix their 1962 game in Alabama’s favor.</p><p>Wally also filed a libel suit against Curtis Publishing Co.</p><p>In August 1963, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia ruled in Butts’ favor. However, Curtis Publishing Co. went on to appeal to the Supreme Court.</p><p>Curtis Publishing was compelled to pay the amount of 3,060,000 dollars in damages to Butts in the case of Curtis Publishing Co. v. Butts, 388 U.S. 130 (1967).</p><p>The case is significant because it sets the parameters for a news agency to be held accountable for defaming a “public person.”</p><p>In January 1964, Paul secured a separate out-of-court settlement with Curtis Publishing for $300,000 on his lawsuits.</p><p><a href=#><strong>You might also be interested in reading Brent Venables: Football, Coaching, Family & Hardships>>></strong></a></p><h2>Bear Bryant: Awards and Achievements</h2><p>During his lifetime, Bear Bryant was awarded many honors and achievements.
