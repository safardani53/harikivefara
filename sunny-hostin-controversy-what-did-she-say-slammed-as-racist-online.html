They want to ensure that their boys succeed. They want to ensure that their children succeed. They want to make certain that they succeed.”</p><p>She proceeded, adding to her contentious statement:</p><p>“In several of these studies, the majority of the women are married. Slaves were also owned by white ladies…White women, in particular, want to preserve the patriarchy because it benefits them…they do follow what their husbands do, how their husbands vote.”</p><h2>Sunny Hostin’s remarks aroused outrage online.</h2><p>The internet and numerous other celebrities criticized Sunny Hostin after her remarks about white women wanting to “protect the patriarchy” went viral.&nbsp;According to Mediaite, Fox Business anchor Kennedy replied to Hostin’s statements on Fox News Tonight by criticizing him for making racist and inflammatory remarks on The View.</p><p>“I feel bad for The View’s women because they obviously have some brain damage being trapped inside that fart vacuum next to Whoopi Goldberg.” They’ve inhaled too many toxins, and their brain cells have been damaged.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sunny-Hostin-1.jpg alt="Sunny Hostin" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Sunny’s sources for the supposed knowledge were questioned by Kennedy, who wondered, “Who are these magical White women who are just shields for their racist husbands?”</p><p>When presenter Johnny Jones questioned whether Hostin despises White women or this nation, she replied:</p><p>“I believe both. I believe they are mixed up, and I am surprised that folks on The View have not been disciplined or sanctioned by their network for spouting some of the racist beliefs they do on a regular basis. They’ve become much too used to being harsh and divisive. They are not improving the nation. It’s not a wise discussion. It’s not amusing. When you watch the program, you get nothing of value.”</p><p>Kennedy attacked Sunny Hostin, calling her “a garbage person with garbage opinions,” for “shaming” women who are attempting to care after and provide for their families.</p><p>“I hear there’s a special place in Hell for women who don’t support other women.”</p><p>Not just Kennedy, but numerous other Twitter users chastised Sunny Hostin for being a “racist” and making unsubstantiated claims. As of this writing, Sunny Hostin has not replied to the internet reaction she got for her remarks against White women.</p><h2>Sunny Hostin Wiki</h2><p>Sunny Hostin, born Asunción Cummings, is a lawyer, social commentator, columnist, and multi-platform journalist from the United States.
