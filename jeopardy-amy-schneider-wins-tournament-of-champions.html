I loved all three of them, especially Sam, coolest professor ever. But Amy was my favorite player in the longest time," wrote another.</p><p>"JEOPARDY HISTORY HAS BEEN MADE!!!" a wrote third as the Oakland California-based contestant is the first transgender tournament winner.</p><p>"Congratulations to Amy. As a lifelong fan of Jeopardy! and a trans woman, it means more than I can put into words," wrote another.</p><p>"Really glad that Wednesday's controversial Final did not end up affecting who won the tournament," wrote a fourth.</p><p>A fifth added: "Was rooting for Andrew, but I'm very happy for Amy! She really deserved that win. It was a hard-fought battle and they all played phenomenally."</p><p>A sixth applauded about <a href=#>Amy's known rival:</a> "Very well played game by Andrew. He was oh so close to winning. Just needed a little bit more money going into FJ.</p><p>And to all the naysayers who thought Andrew was just lucky because he only got the<a href=#> Daily Doubles</a>. He got 0/3 today and was still very competitive."</p><p>As a seventh concluded on the lengthiest Jeopardy! tournament in history: "We all made it through this long thing. It’s our final night going to bed before Cris Pannullo is back!"</p><p>After nearly six weeks of tournament season including the Second Chance Competition - regular episodes and&nbsp;<a href=#>reigning ace Cris Pannullo</a>&nbsp;will return&nbsp;no less than tomorrow.</p><h2>'NO REGRETS'</h2><p>The finals saw three players narrowed down from 21 - it began last Monday and with 2 notches, Amy already had a chance to win the crown on Friday.</p><p>Beloved professor Sam instead won his first game of the finals, sending the tournament to a sixth game.</p><p>It looked like Amy was about to clinch it as she went into Final Jeopardy with $15,800 compared to Sam's $11,200 and Andrew's $6,200.</p><p>Both Amy and Sam answered the clue correctly, but in a shocking move, the Professors’ Tournament winner bet his entire $11,200, doubling his pot and securing the win while Amy wagered just $1800.</p><p><a href=#>“Amy threw it,”</a> tweeted one viewer - another agreed: “I kinda thought the same. I think they wanted Sam to get on the board.”</p><p>“I think there was a silent pact to make it last seven games …or it was discovered that Sam was right on the final question about the Bible and he was owed a win,” said another commenter.</p><p>Last Wednesday, Sam was deemed incorrect for a <a href=#>biblical Final Jeopardy answer covered upon airing by The U.S. Sun</a> that many viewers felt should have been accepted.</p><p>Amy broke her silence after Friday's episode and tweeted: “I have no real regrets about my Final Jeopardy wager. I think it was the right move, and would make it every time in that scenario.”</p><p>"I had a decision to make. As long as Andrew didn't win, I'd still be alive. But of course, if *I* won, then I'd be the champion!"</p><p>Amy said she wagered low to ensure Andrew would be blocked out of winning the tournament - if she was incorrect Sam would win, if she was correct, Sam still might have, at worst - but the series would continue.</p><p>"I knew there was an outcome where that wager cost me the entire tournament [if I hadn't won today], and I'd resolved that even if that happened, I wouldn't let it haunt me."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>“And, while I was disappointed, I was glad that Sam got a win, I think you could tell that the audience was glad as well. He played well enough to deserve a win, and he’s so charming!”</p><p>Over the summer, Ken and actress&nbsp;<a href=#>Mayim Bialik</a>, 46,&nbsp;were officially announced as the permanent replacements for the&nbsp;<a href=#>late, great Alex Trebek</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/11/NINTCHDBPICT000777259387.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/11/NINTCHDBPICT000777259383.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/11/NINTCHDBPICT000776493906-2.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2huZ2h9eISWaKGep6CWv6XFjJqksmWjmLWvscidnKtlp567tHnTqKyrppGisq%2FAjKidZpuYlrqxtc6nqmg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./kaitlyn-hunt-arrested-again-plea-deal-revoked.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kaitlyn Hunt Arrested Again, Plea Deal Revoked">&larr;
