"He got cancer," Barrymore shared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on Friday. "And I had a very rare turn of events where I got to take care of him for three years in a hospice." (The actor passed away at age 72, in November 2004.)</p><p>According to Drew, her dad's burial was a cathartic moment for her and her siblings, <strong>John, Jessica</strong>, and<strong> Blyth.</strong> "We buried, well we put his ashes at Joshua Tree," she recalled. "He loved Joshua Tree and I had spent a lot of time with him there whenever I visited. If he had an address at all it was Joshua Tree. If you know Joshua Tree, there are no houses there. So we took his ashes there, and I went to this little motel."</p><p>In a rather spooky moment, Barrymore believed that she connected with her late father's spirit. "I was sleeping until we were all going to wake up and spread the ashes," she shared. "And I felt a thing and I sat up in my bed and the doorknob of my room opened and the door just opened. And I just sat up in bed and I was like, 'Dad?' It was a moment where you can have hope."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Nearly 10 years after her father's death, Barrymore reconciled with her mom in early 2014.</p><p>"She loves [my book]," the actress told DeGeneres on Friday. "I gave her a copy. We’ve talked about it very intimately and I have to say it was such an extraordinary year of my life writing this book. I came to terms with so many things. It’s a love letter to my daughters (<strong>Olive,</strong> 3, and<strong> Frankie</strong>, 18 months) and writing as a mother now myself and my daughters it was just, I found humor in places I didn’t have it before. I had a new perspective where it was different."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGadqpWseqOt0auwpqeimnqwvMSnqmatoGKuo7vUrWSrnZOku6S1y6KloGWnnsGpeceeqWaZmaG2r7OMn5itoJWnequ7x6dka2hhaoNyfY4%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./david-friedberg.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fame | David Friedberg net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024">&larr;
