The TLC personality and Stutzman were married from 2005 to 2011. Stutzman and the kids appeared on one episode of Breaking Amish, but they’ve since kept a low profile.</p><p>Carmela, meanwhile, has four kids from a previous relationship. After she began dating Jeremiah, <a href=#>she made her reality TV debut</a> in 2016 alongside him on <a href=#>the Breaking Amish spinoff, Return to Amish</a>. The show’s third season concluded with the couple’s wedding.</p><p>Less than one year later, however, the duo made headlines when Jeremiah was arrested for domestic violence in April 2017. Carmela alleged in a police report that the incident was not the first time her husband had physically abused her, claiming that he struck her “on a daily basis.”</p><p>The charges against him were dropped in July 2018 after he completed a pretrial diversion, but the pair soon faced more turmoil. In October 2017, Jeremiah claimed that Carmela stole $15,000 before leaving him. Carmela claimed in response that Jeremiah had been physically abusing her. “I’m so scared but I’m free from his manipulation and he can go ahead spread his lies but in the end, [the] truth will come out,” she wrote in a since-deleted Facebook post.</p><p>Jeremiah, for his part, denied her allegations, claiming that his wife was seeking the “spotlight.” After more social media back-and-forth, <a href=#>the duo reconciled before splitting again in 2022</a>. In March of that year, Carmela filed for a restraining order against her husband, alleging that he threatened to “put me 6 feet under.”</p><p>In response, Jeremiah claimed that all of Carmela’s allegations were about things that happened in 2017. “It’s all in the reports from back then,” he alleged <a href=#>while speaking to In Touch</a> in March 2022. “She used the s–t to get the order just to kick me out. It’s sad how quick people are to post stuff like that but turn a blind eye to the change for the better people have made in their life.”</p><p>The reality star also confirmed via social media that he and Carmela were “done” for good. “Why did we break up?” he said in an Instagram video at the time. “I mean, I’m not going to go into detail, but you know, it just didn’t work out.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Keep scrolling for a look back at Jeremiah and Carmela’s complete relationship timeline:</p><p>If you or someone you know are experiencing domestic violence, please call the <a href=#>National Domestic Violence Hotline</a> at 1-800-799-7233 for confidential support.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkt6a%2BxKagmqBdp66jsdFmmKecXay2p7GMnJirpZWhrm6%2BwJucq6tdp7KtrdOipqermJ69bsDIppyloZ6afA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./kaitlyn-greenidge.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kaitlyn Greenidge- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Husband, Ethnicity">&larr;
