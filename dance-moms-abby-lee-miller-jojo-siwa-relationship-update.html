She just does these TikTok videos with my voice, and so it makes me look really bad," Abby told The U.S. Sun in an exclusive interview.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on Dance Moms ">Read More on Dance Moms</h2><p>"I don't think JoJo is that na√Øve. I don't think she's dumb. I think she's a really smart kid when it comes to social media, computers, getting her name out there."</p><p>She further stated: "There's nothing to repair with JoJo."</p><p>The Santa Monica resident shared news of her former dancer recently getting "two new opportunities" that she "worked hard" for.</p><p>"I just congratulated her, texted her yesterday and she texts right back," Abby, who recently <a href=#>provided a health update</a> to The U.S. Sun, spilled.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>"No matter what I say, when I say it - even if I'm giving her corrections - she always gets back to me immediately.</p><p>"And she said, 'I love you. Thank you.'"</p><h2>TAKING CREDIT FOR JOJO'S FAME</h2><p>Despite JoJo claiming the "stress rash" on <a href=#>the side of her head</a> is from her days on Dance Moms, Abby says that she wouldn't be where she is today if it weren't for the show.</p><p>"She knows why she's here. She knows that the success of Dance Moms and her coming from&nbsp;Abby's Ultimate Dance Competition - [they] catapulted her into millions and millions of homes," Abby said.</p><p>"Would she still be a star today? I believe she would still be a star, but not to the magnitude that she is.</p><p>"She'd be successful, but not a multi-millionaire.</p><p>"That was because of [Dance Moms]. And she knows that."</p><p>The 19-year-old star is <a href=#>reportedly worth $20million</a>.</p><h2>JOJO'S SWEET GESTURE</h2><p><a href=#>JoJo</a> paid Abby back a little back in the form of a sweet gesture.</p><p>In an online auction for her former dance studio that ended last month - she previously <a href=#>sold the Pittsburgh, PA dance studio</a> - JoJo took home something special.</p><p>"I'm excited to announce she just bought the bench now at the studio in Pittsburgh. JoJo bid $10,000," Abby told The U.S. Sun, adding that the singer started bidding at $1,500.</p><p>"It sits in the entrance of the studio. What I've heard is the guy that ran the auction, he is going to fly [to California] with the bench, put it together... and present JoJo with the bench and film all that for the world to see."</p><h2>HER FALLING OUT WITH MADDIE ZIEGLER</h2><p>Although she's on good terms with JoJo and remains close to dancer Gianna Martello, the same can't be said for her ongoing feud with <a href=#>Maddie Ziegler</a>, 20, and her mom Melissa.</p><p>Prior to serving her <a href=#>prison sentence for bankruptcy fraud</a>, Abby had alleged Maddie and Melissa stole $130K that was missing.</p><p>After serving eight months, Abby <a href=#>revealed on The Dr. Oz Show that Maddie "distanced" herself</a>.</p><p>"You know, these kids look back and <a href=#>they wanna crap all over the show, and me</a> personally," Abby said.</p><p>"I don't get it. I'd just like to get in their heads and know who told them what about me and why, and this, that, and the other thing.</p><p>"I mean, if you knew your mother was stealing money from me (referring to Melissa Ziegler), if you knew she was skimming the pot, if you knew all that, you're still gonna feel that angst towards me?</p><p>"No, I think you got the cover, but you had to promise them some dirt to get that cover."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/founder-abby-lee-dance-company-798353377.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/founder-abby-lee-dance-company-798353483-1.jpg><h2>ADDRESSING 'BULLY' CLAIMS</h2><p>Abby, who is <a href=#>pushing for a trial</a> in an ongoing discrimination lawsuit, questioned: "I just wonder what goes on in those kids' heads that don't talk to [me] anymore."</p><p>"[Dance Moms] destroyed a lot of relationships," she claimed.</p><p>The choreographer still questions to this day why former cast think Dance Moms was "so toxic" and why <a href=#>she's called "the biggest bully."</a></p><p>"Did I bully the kids? Some may use that term incorrectly because I made them the best that they could be.</p><p>"Look, these were the kids I had to work with... I had a group of kids that I needed to be put on stage week after week and did 500 [dance] numbers," she said in response to the bully claims.</p><p>"So I had to pull that group together and make them look great, whether I was tough, nice, sweet - however you wanna call it."</p><p>She added: "I had to do my job and it was my name and my reputation... So was I a bully? No, not in my eyes.</p><p>"I slept like a baby. But did I put work on that show that would win? Yes, I did. Too bad nobody ever turned it in for <a href=#>an Emmy</a>."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>All in all, what she remembers the most from Dance Moms was "the giggles, the laughter, and the good times, the fun times."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/tv-personalities-dancers-kendall-vertes-791332880.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/abby-lee-miller-jojo-siwa-637257274.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hvZWd%2BcYKPaJuappOaeq67zKxkmpqSrnqtscRmpKKknJq%2FbrbOo6Zmq5msrm6%2BxKWYraGfo8Cptc9mrKmckamycA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./freddie-dennis-bio-parents-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="His Bio, Parents, Net Worth And More">&larr;
