Another game came against Mercer, when he threw for three passing touchdowns in a 56-0 victory.</li><li>Hurts was replaced in the second half of the 2018 College Football Playoff National Championship due to his inept performance in January 2018. In extra time, he fired a game-winning 41-yard touchdown pass to another real first-year recruit, wide receiver DeVonta Smith, as the Crimson Tide defeated the Georgia Bulldogs, 26-23, to claim their seventeenth National Championship.</li><li>He finished the game 14-of-24 for 166 yards, three touchdowns, and one interception, with 27 yards rushing on 12 attempts.

He finished 26-of-31 with 336 passing yards, four touchdowns, and no interceptions. He did not play in the fourth quarter. The preceding round of the era was a home opening victory against New Mexico State.</li><li>Tua was invited to the NFL Combine, but he couldn’t participate in any of the activities since he wasn’t fully recovered from his injuries.
