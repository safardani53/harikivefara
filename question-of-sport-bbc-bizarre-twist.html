The clue is in the title.”</p><p>At least Beeb bosses seem to have finally picked up on that.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/01-24-08-2021-673762688.jpg><h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Daisy's big kiss-off</h2><p>THERE was nobody waiting to snog <a href=#>Daisy May Cooper</a> under the mistletoe after an embarrassing rumour at a works Christmas party.</p><p>Before her rise to fame, the This Country comic’s chances of kissing her supermarket job crush were ruined when someone told colleagues she was hiding a big secret.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/leigh-anne-pinnock-ricky-wilson-867124355.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/leigh-anne-pinnock-ricky-wilson-867124278.jpg><p>On Sky Max music quiz Never Mind The Buzzcocks’ Christmas special, which is being screened at 8pm tomorrow, Daisy tells her co-stars <a href=#>Noel Fielding</a>, <a href=#>Harry Hill</a>, <a href=#>Leigh-Anne Pinnock</a> and Ricky Wilson: “When I was working at <a href=#>Waitrose</a>, someone spread a rumour that I was a man. I never found out who it was.</p><p>“But there was a bloke who fancied me, and he was going to snog me at the Christmas party.</p><p>“But then he said, ‘I can’t snog you under the mistletoe because, apparently, you’re a man’.”</p><p>The tale is followed by another Christmas mishap story, when Daisy reveals she was given a used razor by her grandad.</p><p>She says: “He was really tight, so he gave me an old razor with just bits of old flesh in it.”</p><p>Quick as a flash, show host <a href=#>Greg Davies</a> responds: “He heard those rumours you were a bloke.”</p><p><h3

been for me.</p><p>“It made me realise I shouldn’t do that again, so that was my brush with theft.”</p><p>He is reminded of his crime whenever he hears Barry’s song Copacabana, and said: “It’s still very traumatic.”</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Neighbours' festive theme</h3></p><p>AMAZON Freevee has announced new episodes of Neighbours will continue to air through
