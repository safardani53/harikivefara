She’s also a radio host for ESPN, according to her website.</p><h3>Personal Life</h3><p>Sabrina was born and raised in Cleveland, Ohio. She was born in Atlanta, Georgia, on May 1, 1987. Antonio Davis was her husband.</p><p>Sabrina frequently updates her social media sites with photos of her three children; two daughters, and a son.

Sabrina hit him in the back of the head with a trophy.</p><p>As Sabrina left him injured, Davis contacted 911 for help.&nbsp;Sabrina received a three-year probationary sentence as well as a six-month prison sentence.</p><h3>Calling off the Engagement</h3><p>Sabrina Parr and her then-fiancé <a href=#>Lamar Odom</a> called off their engagement in November 2020, stating that the former NBA star “has some difficulties that he alone has to deal through.”</p><p>“I had to be the first to let you all know that I am no longer engaged to Lamar,” Parr said on her Instagram Story.</p><p>“This has been a difficult decision for me to make,” she said, “but it is the right decision for myself and my children.” “Lamar has some issues that he must resolve on his own.”</p><p>Parr stated on Wednesday that she loves Odom “very much,” but that she is “no longer able to remain by his side while he finds the care he so urgently needs.”</p><p>“I wish him the best of luck, and I ask that you pray for everyone involved,” she said.</p><p>Odom, who had battled drug addiction in the past, was found unconscious at a Nevada brothel in 2015 and suffered a near-fatal overdose.</p><p>Odom’s representative did not respond to our request for comment right away.</p><h3>The Reunion</h3><p>After calling off their engagement, Lamar Odom and his ex-fiancée, Sabrina Parr, reunited to celebrate Thanksgiving together later that month.</p><p>On Thursday, November 26, the fitness trainer, posted an Instagram selfie of herself and Odom, posing with her kid from a previous relationship.</p><p>“On this day, I’m very grateful to be surrounded by love!” “From my family to yours, Happy Thanksgiving,” Parr said in the caption.</p><p>On November 4, exactly one year after announcing their engagement, Parr revealed her split from Odom.</p><p>Parr and Odom celebrated their one-year engagement anniversary a few days later. The retired basketball player uploaded a photo that Parr had initially shared on her Instagram Story. Odom kissed his then-fiancée on the cheek in the photo.</p><p>She captioned the photo with a kissy face and a prayer-hand emoji, saying, “Made it in time for our one-year anniversary.”</p><p>When Odom posted a photo of Parr sitting in his lap on Instagram in August 2019, the two became official. “We have a lot more than they can see…” The caption was written by Odom. The couple confirmed their engagement three months later.</p><p>Odom and Parr announced their engagement in August on Instagram, and they plan to marry on November 11, 2021, in Miami.</p><p>From 2009 until their divorce in 2013, Odom was married to <a href=#>Khloé Kardashian</a>. After he had a near-fatal overdose in 2015, the former couple’s divorce was put on hold, but it was finalized in 2016.</p><h3>Book</h3><p>In an Instagram post, Parr revealed that she’ll be releasing a book called The Freedom in Walking Away, which will explain the end of her relationship with Odom.</p><p>“I formally broke up with my ex-fiance one year ago today. I didn’t tell anyone (including him); I simply left! I knew that the more I talked about my dissatisfaction, the more at ease I’d get in it “Parr expressed. “We were about to tie the knot in less than a year. I was terrified, hurt, and afraid of what might happen, but I knew I would never be free if I stayed.”</p><p>A few hours later, in an Instagram post addressed to his “exes and next,” Odom appeared to respond to Parr’s news with his own account of the “toxic” and “abusive” relationship’s conclusion.</p><p>“We were poisonous. Both individually and collectively, “According to Odom.</p><p>Despite the fact that leaving the relationship “broke” his heart, Odom claims it “saved” his soul. The athlete further admitted that he wished to return to the “dysfunction” since the “addict in me feared being alone.”</p><p>Parr added in her article, which also mentions a previous violent marriage, that her book will teach readers about “I’ve had a lot of situations in my life where I’ve had to walk away. You’ll hear about how suffocating my hand was while grasping someone else’s!”</p><p>“I’m really looking forward to sharing myself with all of you and taking you on this journey with me. It’s time to set yourself free! It’s time to find peace, and I hope that after you’ve finished reading this book, I can assist you in doing so “she stated</p><h2>Short Glance on Lamar Odom</h2><p>Lamar Odom is a basketball player who has participated in the National Basketball Association (NBA).
