This year, that sneaker seems to be a classic pair of white lace-ups from Thousand Fell. Like a lot of people, I’ve gradually adopted the trend of wearing sneakers with just about everything, from athleisure outfits to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>date night dresses</a>. Still, I usually only&nbsp;have one to two favorite pair of sneakers and tend to not stray from those options.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Even though I had heard good things about Thousand Fell sneakers, I didn’t quite think they were worth adding another pair to my closet when I already owned pairs that looked so similar. But when I finally ordered a pair and started testing out the Thousand Fell lace-ups myself (and learning more about the brand), I started to understand the hype. I ordered my pair from the Thousand Fell website (though they’re also available through Madewell, Bloomingdale’s, Zappos, and other retailers), where my size was readily available and the check-out process was a breeze. The sneakers arrived in a timely manner in one of the most interesting, easy-to-break down packages I’ve received from a retailer, and they also came with a free <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>tote bag</a>, which was a nice surprise.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Thousand Fell</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Buy It! </strong>Thousand Fell Women’s White Lace-Up, $145; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">thousandfell.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Also available at:</strong> <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Madewell</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Bloomingdale’s</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Zappos</a></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-we-tested-thousand-fell-white-lace-up-sneakers></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How We Tested Thousand Fell White Lace-Up Sneakers</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I ordered the shoes in my typical size, and found them to be true to size and immediately comfortable, just as advertised. Over the course of six weeks, I wore the shoes for my typical day-to-day activity, which included working at my standing desk and usually running errands. I also wore them on a few longer walks, and they held up well.</p><p>Though I still prefer to wear sneakers with socks, they also held up to the promise of being comfortable enough to wear sockless, and after wearing them without socks a couple of times, I can say that the odor-free promise also proved to be true. I also wore them in the rain, and they stood up to the water-resistant claim, as well.</p><p>Overall, the thing I loved most about these sneakers is their sleek, modern design. I love that there isn’t a huge brand logo stuck on the side of them; this helped them blend in seamlessly with every single outfit I wore, and also gave them a bit of an elevated feel. Also, they look exactly like leather; it actually shocked me when I learned that the material was actually a coated fabric.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Olivia Muenter</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-results></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Results</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After nearly two months of owning them, the sneakers remained mostly scuff and damage-free (also as promised by the brand) and were even more comfortable than the first time I put them on. I can admit that for most people, at first glance, these sneakers won’t seem all that different from other pairs. The differences are subtle but ultimately hugely impactful. From the sleek, simple design to the construction to the material to the packaging, Thousand Fell is clearly doing things differently, and we think it pays off. While I don’t think every single person needs these in their closet if they already own a dozen pairs of sneakers, I do think that these are worth considering first if you need a classic, sleek, versatile pair of lace-up sneakers in your wardrobe.<br></p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Who They're Good For</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This sneaker would be great for anyone who’s looking for everyday sneakers that don’t have a big brand logo front and center. They’re also great for those concerned with recyclability or sustainability or those who are interested in shopping for leather-alternatives that still have the look of leather. People who love to wear sneakers without socks but sometimes struggle with foot odor would also appreciate these.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><li>Water-, scuff-, and stain-resistant</li><li>Made from recycled bottles and yoga mats, natural rubber, and food waste parts</li><li>Odor-free</li><li>Easy to break in</li><li>Comfortable, plush insoles</li></ul><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Who They're Not Good For</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you're looking for a genuine leather sneaker, these won't be for you — while they have a leather look, they are made from a coated fabric. Also, while we personally think they are worth the price, they are rather expensive if you're just wanting a non-leather white sneaker and aren't as concerned with paying extra for the smaller carbon footprint.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><li>More expensive than other similar white sneakers on the market</li><li>Not made of genuine leather, if you prefer that</li></ul><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Olivia Muenter</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-consider-before-buying-thousand-fell-sneakers></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Consider Before Buying Thousand Fell Sneakers</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Sustainability Factor</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The first thing to know about Thousand Fell’s White Lace-Up Sneakers is probably the first thing to know about the Thousand Fell brand as a whole: They’re some of the most sustainable sneakers on the market. Made from recycled plastic bottles and natural materials like coconut and sugar, they’re specifically designed not only to last as long as possible, but also be as recyclable as possible. Plus, when you're ready for a new pair, they'll recycle them for you and refund your $20 recycling deposit you paid when you originally purchased the shoes.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Comfort</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In terms of comfort, the sneakers are equipped with a footbed made with recycled yoga mats (making them cushioned and comfortable), and a mesh liner that makes them breathable enough to be worn without socks. Both of these features also add to another unique benefit — being odor-free. The liners are sweat-wicking and odor-resistant. Even though they look like leather, the material is actually a coated fabric, which means there’s no tricky break-in period like some other leather sneakers. They’re also water-repellent, scuff-resistant, and have been tested to withstand up to “2.4 million steps,” according to the brand.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Intended Function</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Next, ask yourself how exactly you plan to wear them. If you always wear socks with sneakers, then the option to wear these sock-free might not be an important factor in your decision to buy or not. Alternatively, if you like the idea of being able to put on a pair of sneakers without worrying about socks or foot odor, then these could be a perfect fit for your wardrobe. If you’re committed to an authentic leather pair of sneakers, then these won’t be for you, of course, but if you’ve been frustrated in the past with the break-in period of leather sneakers (but love the look of them), then they could be just what you're needing.<br></p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Durability</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to the biggest question people often ask themselves about white sneakers —&nbsp;if they’ll get dirty quickly —&nbsp;then you should know that these may get a little bit scuffed or dirty eventually. However, during my testing period, they stayed white and new-looking for much longer than alternative options, no doubt thanks to the scuff- and water-resistant feature.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-other-white-sneakers-to-consider></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Other White Sneakers to Consider</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Cariuma White Knit Sneaker</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Cariuma</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Buy It! </strong>Cariuma Triple White Premium Leather Sneaker, $139; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">cariuma.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Though they come in at a slightly higher price point, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Cariuma’s Triple White Premium Leather Sneakers</a> look almost identical to Thousand Fell’s White Lace-Ups at first glance. They’re bright white with a sleek, simple design and white laces, but there are a few differences. First of all, this Cariuma shoe is made from genuine leather, which probably explains the slightly higher cost. Aside from the leather material, this specific pair of Cariuma sneakers are made from some recycled plastic, organic cotton, canvas, and rubber — overall making Thousand Fell’s sneakers the more sustainable option. However, like Thousand Fell, Cariuma has also established more <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">environmentally friendly initiatives</a> behind its production.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Lucky Brand Darleena Sneaker</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>DSW</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Buy It! </strong>Lucky Brand Darleena Sneaker, $78.99; <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">amazon.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lucky’s Darleena’s Sneakers are another pair of lace-ups that look a whole lot like Thousand Fell's. Some quick differences: They go up to a size 12 (Thousand Fell only goes up to a size 10), feature a tan interior and sole, and are made out of genuine leather (instead of a leather lookalike). Though they don’t have any of the sustainability features that the Thousand Fell sneakers offer, they are less expensive and have quite a few positive customer reviews.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faq></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>FAQ</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Are Thousand Fell Sneakers Worth It?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Through our experience, the design, construction, and sustainability of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Thousand Fell Sneakers</a> make them a smart purchase.

For the six weeks I tested them, my shoes stayed clean enough that I never needed to do this, which seems like a good sign. However, when you do need to swap them out for a new pair, you can send them back to the brand to recycle (and they’ll send you your recycling credit back). The brand site also says they’re coming out with upkeep kits for the shoes soon, which could potentially help with their longevity.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Olivia Muenter</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-take-our-word-for-it></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Take Our Word For It</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-69 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Olivia Muenter</a> is a full-time freelance beauty and fashion writer.
