His first marriage was to Wendy Pearl, and they tied the knot in 1973. Their marriage didn’t result in any children.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Pete-Glena.webp><p>However, their paths diverged, and they eventually separated in 1975, marking the conclusion of that chapter in Pete’s life.</p><p>Maintaining a steadfast commitment to privacy, Pete and Wendy have seldom disclosed their personal matters to the media.</p><p>Consequently, the reasons underpinning their separation remain a closely guarded secret, intriguingly withheld from public knowledge to this day.</p><h2>Pete Carroll Wife, Glena Goranson, Is A Former Volleyball Player</h2><p><a href=#>Pete Carroll</a>‘s introduction to Glena Goranson traces back to their college years at the University of the Pacific, where they both pursued their respective passions.</p><p>Carroll showcased his talents on the football field, while Glena excelled in indoor volleyball. Their connection deepened over time, leading to their joyful union in 1976.</p><p>Throughout their journey, Carroll has deliberately shielded his family from the glare of the spotlight, opting to maintain a private sphere.</p><p>Interviews rarely touch upon his family, leaving little beyond publicly available information about their children’s education and career paths.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Glena-Pete-Together.webp><p>In 2009, rumors circulated alleging Carroll’s involvement with a USC grad student, an accusation that stirred controversy.</p><p>The origins of these rumors were traced back to comments made by Charlie Weis, which Carroll vehemently denied, denouncing them as “untrue, irresponsible, and incredible.”</p><p>Notably, no credible sources beyond Weis’ remarks substantiated these claims, and they ultimately fizzled out without gaining traction.</p><h3>Glena Used To Babysit for Lane Kiffin, Head Coach&nbsp;of the&nbsp;Ole Miss Rebels</h3><p>During the formative stages of Pete Carroll’s coaching journey, Glena steadfastly stood by his side, offering her support and assistance whenever needed.</p><p>One instance highlighting her commitment occurred during Carroll’s collaboration with Monte Kiffin at the University of Arkansas.</p><p>Glena’s thoughtful gesture extended to offering babysitting services for Kiffin’s son, a certain Lane Kiffin, as reported by Player Wives.</p><p>Remarkably, this baby, none other than Lane Kiffin, has since evolved into a widely recognized football coach.</p><p>In the present day, Lane Kiffin has ascended to the role of head coach at the University of Mississippi.</p><h2>Pete Carroll Kids With His Wife, Glena Goranson</h2><h3 id=firstHeading class="firstHeading mw-first-heading"><span class=mw-page-title-main>Brennan Carroll</span></h3><p>Born on March 20, 1979, <a href=#>Brennan Carroll,</a> the first child of Pete and Glena, currently holds the role of offensive coordinator for the Arizona Wildcats.
