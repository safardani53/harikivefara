Some women like to go to the salon for a professional protein treatment, but these can be expensive. A lot of brands have started manufacturing protein-infused products that you can easily use at home. These are convenient and do not break the bank.</span></p><h3><span>What Are Protein Treatments for Hair?</span></h3><p><span>Protein treatments for hair are designed to infuse proteins like keratin into the hair. Our hair is basically made of protein, and keratin is the major protein found in hair. When we style our hair, apply excessive heat, and color our hair, the keratin in our hair can begin to break down. This can make your hair brittle and prone to damage. Lack of protein makes the hair frizzy and difficult to manage.</span></p><p><span>Protein treatments help by infusing proteins back into your hair. These can either be done at salons, or at-home treatments like hair masks and conditioners. They work by attaching proteins to your hair strands and cuticles. This helps to make the hair stronger, healthier, and extremely smooth. Other advantages include preventing split-ends, removing tangles, and making the hair much more manageable. However, it should be kept in mind that if used in excess, these treatments can damage the hair by making it stiff and dry. This is why it is important to use a deep conditioner to retain the moisture in your hair.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span>Are Protein Treatments for Hair Suitable for Everyone?</span></h3><p><span>Protein treatments for hair have a lot of benefits because they nourish the hair and make it more manageable. However, not everyone needs it. If your hair already has ample protein, and you add more to it, chances are you will do more damage than good. It is important to examine your hair carefully and then make a decision whether or not you need a protein treatment. Here are a few signs that your hair is in dire need of a protein treatment. If you are still unsure, consult a stylist and get your hair examined by a professional.</span></p><h4><span>Loss of elasticity</span></h4><p><span>Strands of hair are typically elastic. To check for yourself, wet a strand of your hair, while it is still attached to your head, and stretch it. If it comes back to its original shape, your hair is elastic. However, if it breaks or remains stretched, your hair has lost its elasticity. That means that your hair needs more protein.</span></p><h4><span>High porosity</span></h4><p><span>Porous hair means there are gaps in the strands of hair, which make it vulnerable to damage and frizz. If you notice high porosity in your hair, it means your hair needs a protein treatment. It will work by strengthening your hair and filling in those gaps.</span></p><h4><span>Colored hair</span></h4><p><span>Bleaching and coloring your hair excessively can cause a lot of damage to your hair. Split-ends form and the hair becomes dry and brittle. If you have colored your hair several times, you may need a protein treatment to bring nourishment back to your hair.&nbsp;</span></p><h4><span>Excessive breakage</span></h4><p><span>If you have recently noticed that you are shedding a lot of hair, it may be a sign that your hair lacks protein. Losing up to 100 strands of hair is considered, but if you are shedding hair excessively, you may want to consider getting a protein treatment for your hair.</span></p><h3><span>How Long Does a Protein Treatment for Hair Last?</span></h3><p><span>This will depend on the kind of protein treatment you are getting and the type of hair you have. If you are getting a professional keratin treatment from the salon, it can last from about three to six months. However, you need to take special care and use a sulfate-free shampoo along with a protein mask. This will keep your hair nourished and will increase the life of your protein treatment.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>At home protein treatments are different. Some are in the form of conditioners and hair masks which can be applied regularly, whenever you shampoo your hair. Some brands recommend that you use their product once a week. Some are in the form of leave-in conditioners and heat protectants. Since these do not have a huge amount of protein, they can be used once or twice a week. Also, they contain moisturizers that nourish the hair and prevent it from drying out excessively. Therefore, whatever protein treatment you opt for, make sure that you follow the instructions given by the brand.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span>How to Pick a Quality Protein Treatment for Hair</span></h3><p><span>When browsing for a protein treatment, there are a few things you should keep in mind. The first and most important feature is the ingredients list. Make sure the product you are buying has necessary proteins like keratin, collagen, creatinine, and vitamin B-5. Also, make sure that the product will moisturize your hair. If you use a protein treatment that does not condition your hair, it is bound to become dry and frizzy. With these treatments, you need to buy a <a href=#>moisturizer to keep your hair nourished and healthy</a>. Also make sure that the product does not have harmful chemicals like sulfates, parabens, silicone, and isopropyl alcohol. These ingredients make the hair dry and brittle and strip the hair of natural oils.</span></p><p><span>When browsing products online, make sure you keep an eye on customer reviews because they will give you an idea about the quality and functionality of the product. Also, try to buy from companies that provide good customer service. Always compare the features and prices of different companies before making your final decision, so you can make sure you get value for the price you pay.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGipnq6ZmsRwvMSrqqimkaF6pK3Rnmapqp%2Bpsqq6jK2pnpmkorKvwIyhmKKqXw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./90-day-fiance-original-couples-who-is-still-together.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="'90 Day Fiance' Original Couples: Who Is Still Together?">&larr;
