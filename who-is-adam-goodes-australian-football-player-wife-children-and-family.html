Get in touch with us to learn more about Goodes. Adam Goodes was a former Australian rules footballer who played with the Club Sydney Swans in the Australian Football League (AFL). Stay tuned for more about her daughter Adelaide, his wife Natalie, and their family. Adam is also an Australian representative in the International Rules Series.</p><p>Adam formerly held the record for the most VFL/AFL games played by an indigenous player, which Andre Mcleod previously held, but Shaun Burgoyne snatched the title during the 2019 AFL season. Adam is also a dual Brownlow Medallist in VFL/AFL history. Adam hung up his boots following a 26-point defeat to North Melbourne in the 2015 AFL semi-finals.</p><h2>Adam Goodes Children: A Father of Adelaide</h2><p>Adam’s first kid is Adelaide. She was born in the year 2018. More information regarding Adelaide and Adam’s personal lives is kept hidden, which is understandable given his desire for privacy and confidentiality.&nbsp;However, the media often captures Adelaide and Adam in public, allowing us to see that he has a very deep and loving relationship with his daughter.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Adam-Goodes-1.jpg alt="Adam Goodes" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Adam gave birth to his second kid in 2021; no more information about the infant has been made public. Adam and his wife Natalie have revealed very little about their children’s lives. Nonetheless, information regarding their daughter has been shared because of his supporters.</p><h2>Meet Adam, Natalie, and their family.</h2><p>Adam and Natalie married in 2016 after dating for two years. The pair married in a small ceremony attended by about 20 people. Natalie explains that they wanted the wedding to be amongst their closest friends and not on Instagram.&nbsp;Two months after their low-key wedding, the couple decided to host a celebration for 200 relatives and friends at Sydney’s Carriageworks.</p><p>Adam Goodes was born on January 8, 1980, in Wallaroo, South Australia, to Graham Goodes and Lisa May. His mother was Adnyamathanha Narungga, while his father was of Irish and Scottish origin.&nbsp;When Adam was four years old, his parents divorced, and he relocated to Merbein, Victoria, with his mother and two younger brothers, Jake and Brett.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Adam-Goodes-2.jpg alt="Adam Goodes" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Adam Goodes’s Childhood and Career</h2><p>At his school, Adam began playing Australian rules football. He joined the North Ballarat under-18 club when he was 16 years old.&nbsp;Adam was recruited by the Sydney Swans of the Australian Football League after two years. Adam made his debut in 1999, at the age of 19, and earned the season’s Rising Star Award.&nbsp;Adam lacked consistency while playing in numerous positions in 2000 and 2001. Adam was on the brink of being cut from the squad in 2002, as his performance was deteriorating on a regular basis. However, his form improved with time, and he began to play more in rucks.</p><p>Adam earned the Bob Skilton Medal and an Australian selection for the first time at the conclusion of the 2003 season.&nbsp;In 2009, he was the top player all season. He became the AFL’s fastest player to 300 games, smashing Mark Ricciuto’s previous record by 274 days.&nbsp;Goodes also received the Brownlow Medal, the league’s highest personal accolade, with Collingwood’s Nathan Buckley and Adelaide’s Mark.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiuoaddnsBurcOapGafn6Sxpr%2BMmqysrKKWuaqtzWadqKekl66tuIypo5qxlad6uLXFnmScoJmhsbOxzWaYp5xdm66utcuyZg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./alix-earle-partners-with-pj-place-for-early-black-friday-sale-5183364.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="80% Off  Hollywood Life">&larr;
