We applaud our employees and the passengers that made her feel extra-special on this flight. Southwest Employees go above and beyond each day to share our hearts with the customers we serve, and we loved getting to play a small role in celebrating this incredible moment for her."</p><p>In another <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a>, Laura noted that Jessa had been battling leukemia for over two years.
