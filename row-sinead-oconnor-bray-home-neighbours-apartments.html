This we would regard as disrespectful and unhelpful.</p><p>“This will be considerable and very oppressive for our clients.”</p><p>Local David Armstrong added: “Bray is famous as a Victorian seafront.</p><p>“In my view it would be improper, careless, and contrary to the Local Area Plan to allow a prominent Victorian heritage property to be dramatically altered in the proposed way.</p><p>“It is not appropriate to attach a modern additional storey to a Victorian roofline.”</p><p>Gareth Douglas said the development would impact sunlight being able to reach his back garden as well as allowing people to see in.</p><p>The council refused the application - but a month later chartered town planner Colin McGill submitted an appeal on behalf of Rachel Carthy.</p><p>It reads: “The proposed roof profile to the attic conversion will not detract from the character of the seafront.</p><p>“It will not impact on protected structures nor protected views.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>"Relative to the scale of buildings beside the subject site, the proposed development will not have a material impact on the character of the seafront.”</p><p>An Bord Pleanála - the Irish national planning body responsible for deciding appeals - is due to determine the house’s fate by September.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.ie/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/08/NINTCHDBPICT000642248058.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.ie/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/08/NINTCHDBPICT000642248019.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2tmqaUqLWww8GisWhqY2eFeISYcmarp6diwKq6xJqbZqeTpLuvu9FmmauZqWK1sLnEZqWeoZedr7DB0axkmqiRp8Gusc2tqmg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./micah-givens-movie-actor-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Micah Givens (Movie Actor) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More">&larr;
