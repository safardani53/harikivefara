Hawke and Shawhughes first met when she was the nanny to his children from his previous marriage to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Uma Thurman</a>, although they were not romantically involved at the time. The pair reconnected a year after his divorce from Thurman and began dating.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hawke and Shawhughes eventually <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>tied the knot</a> in June 2008 and had two children together, daughters Clementine Hawke and Indiana Hawke.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In a 2009 <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>interview with The Guardian</a>, Hawke opened up about his and Shawhughes' relationship. "I was very cautious during that period of my life and desperately wanted to stay single," he said. "But sometimes life happens to you. Now, I love Ryan tremendously. The bottom line is we're incredibly compatible. We grew up in the same town, you know, all that old school s--- your grandma told you."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He added of Shawhughes, "She has always been an extremely sensible, no-bullshit woman, and frankly I thought that might be good for a half-madman like me."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So, who is Ethan Hawke's wife?

She played a small role in the 2006 movie adaptation of Hawke's novel, The Hottest State, which was directed by Hawke himself. In July 2022, she starred as herself in the sixth episode of the Hawke-directed TV documentary, The Last Movie Stars (she produced the fifth episode as well).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She is also the producer of several movies, documentaries and TV series, including First Reformed and Blaze, which was written and directed by Hawke. She's the executive producer of the Peabody and Emmy Award-winning limited series, The Good Lord Bird.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to acting and producing, Shawhughes is the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>vice president of Hawke's production company</a>, Under the Influence Productions, where she works with her husband to "develop and produce content for projects in the art and entertainment sector, including film, theater, and literature."

"After a short period of working for me, Ryan went back to Columbia to get her degree. There were never any scandalous thoughts or actions back then. In the years that followed, my marriage disintegrated due to many pressures, none of which were remotely connected to Ryan."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After his split with Thurman, he ran into Ryan in a park and they connected instantly. "I know people imagine some kind of Sound of Music type love affair, but the truth is by the time Ryan and I were falling in love, it had been a long while since I had employed her," he said.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-they-have-been-married-for-over-a-decade></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>They have been married for over a decade</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Rick Kern/FilmMagic</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In June 2008, PEOPLE confirmed that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Hawke and Shawhughes had tied the knot</a> in a small ceremony in New York City.
