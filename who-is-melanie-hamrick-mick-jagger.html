Mother and baby are doing well and we request that the media respect their privacy at this time."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As he's grown, Deveraux has begun to enjoy music and dance just like his parents.

"I don't have him in classes yet. He plays the ukulele and makes up songs. He's got the gene. Definitely. I really want him to take tap. For a little boy to make some noise with his feet?

"The schedule of A.B.T. is great, but it's hard when you have a child and the life I have now.

But sometimes my head is not there."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hamrick spent 15 years with the ensemble. Before her final year, she spent the off-season choreographing Porte Rouge, a ballet set to music by The Rolling Stones. Her experience on the other side of the table gave Hamrick a new perspective on her craft.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I got so excited when I choreographed Porte Rouge," she told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Pointe magazine</a>.
